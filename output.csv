Amazon,Merediths,What to do career wise?,"Hey blindersI'm 29F. I have been a hustler and competitive until recently. Now I feel like not doing SDE anymore. Although I have 4.5 years of experience. I'm laid off in April. Lately, I am not wanting this career. I should want it as I'm on a visa. I feel like I can do something else to earn a living but not this. I do not feel like going into corporate. Hence I'm not trying to get a job. Ideally I should just work towards it but Idk why I'm not doing that.I considered SDE jobs to be cool and easy going but lately workplace has become such toxic that I don't feel like going into that setup again.

Milbank,zinger23,Have cried all day today and have fallen into depression after horrible promotion increase last week.,"So last week I got promoted for my role, and I have been busting my ass for this role for the past 2 years now. Located in Boston - remote. I live with my parents because of horrible salary.My base went from 119k to 135k, after being told I have been doing great and I have great promise. No other bonuses of any kind. I am also extremely underpaid to other people on same level as I have talked to other people who make 150 - 160k for the same role.Compare to other folks my age, I am 26 btw, I feel like an absolute bum. I put so much effort to try to get noticed, and kept getting told it’ll be rewarded, but this it?Am I wrong to be depressed, I feel totally checked out. I don’t even want to continue.

Cisco,decode4lyf,Can’t anymore,"It’s endless. The harder you work, the more responsibilities you get. I hate taking ownership of things. There’s too much learning to do. Too many problems to solve which increase in scope and take a toll on your mental health. The brain should not be working this hard, all the time. I don’t love SWE, but SWE loves me; the money has me hooked. How can I possibly take a 50% paycut? Plus, I have no other employable skills. Every morning I wake up and open my laptop and see the queue of messages and emails, I feel stressed and trapped.I want happiness but I also want to continue buying things and going on vacations without looking at the price tag. I don’t budget; the money is just there, always, and there’s lots of it. Not enough to retire though.I’ve tried taking a break - didn’t make a difference. It’s not burnout, it’s a hate with SWE and tech industry as a whole.I always thought of starting my own company though.

Zovio,vEPk85,Marriage - No physical touch in 6 years,"I am failing to find a solution to this.My wife was physically attached to me 1st year of marriage.After getting pregnant, she stopped being physical. She cited lack of emotional attachment.Even after 6 years, when I say therapy or consultation, she says yes but doesn't go.She is skilled at lying, gaslighting and blaming but over the years I just do what she says and try not to upset her in anyway.After 6 years, she still cites emotional issues, though I don't know what as she won't tell me.On a daily basis, we laugh, banter about different things and talk mostly around our child.I am the sole earning guy. She doesn't cook for me, so I don't burden her in anyway.It was very tough when she stopped physical suddenly over minor quarrel first year. Overtime it became better as I started sleeping in a seperate room (citing late work).I don't know what to do here. By nature, I am a quiet observer and an overall nice guy.ps. - divorce is not an option because we have a kid and 5 years ago she did get her uncle supreme court lawyer to threaten me with 498A, DV and all things false. Oh! I just do what she says and wants post then.EDIT:- Friends, I am forever grateful for you to listen to my difficulties.Even the harshest critic brings tears to my eyes. There is humanity in the world and people care!!! I love you all.In my culture, no one, including my people, would listen to a word against women, regardless of where the fault lies.Even if she framed me the first year in a guilt trip, based on her lawyers instruction and/or difference in culture (I am more Americanzed). The fact remains - Today she is still with me and hasn't left me. Today, I am suffering. Today, I am silent.And I don't have any cases on me yet, because I chose to bow down - give all money, support , understand and learn culture, don't question.But I hear you all.

New,fallcolor3,It’s officially getting to me,"I worked my butt off in college - thinking it’ll all be worth it at the end.But now after some unfortunate events in my life I am not working and I’m struggling a lot to grapple with that.I feel extremely overwhelmed and like I’m not getting anywhere despite challenging myself and working hard. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. This whole process of interviewing has so many components and I’m worried by the time I have it all down the rules will change again. I feel as if I’m living in uncertainty and it’s difficult not to ponder on the system and how it feels rigged from day 0.Sure with an education, you can get far but there are so many other factors that aren’t discussed. You need to have all the correct components in place to make it. A support system. Time and a lot of it. Money. Good teachers. Reinforced mental models and data about your specialization - this means starting young. A sprinkle of nepotism. And maybe just maybe you’ll make it. By make it, I mean living a life where you don’t have sky high anxiety everyday about bills or toxic people in your life.How can you control for these factors when you’re just an average joe? And when you mention any of these things, people dismiss you saying your not trying hard enough. How do they know how much you’re trying or how much anyone for that matter is trying?It’s difficult to feel that you’re not in control of your life and that there isn’t really a direct relation to your effort and the results. It seems like a whole lot of luck is involved.How does one continue putting effort while knowing that luck is a big part of it? How does one trust the system in place?I get discouraged thinking that it’s luck based even after sacrificing so much. Then why do anything at all.

Okta,The_bob,"Meditation is the silver bullet , the elixir of life , the cure.","Alright, looks like I oversold it on the title. But, hear me out.I had bit of a traumatic childhood and struggled with anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. I tried therapy and medication, but nothing really helped / really resolved the issue you know. It was basically a wack a mole. It wasn't until I started meditating that I finally found true relief.Meditation has helped me to calm my mind, reduce my anxiety, and improve my self-esteem. I feel more peaceful and joyful than I ever have before. I'm not saying that meditation is a miracle cure, but it has definitely made a big difference in my life.I found a spiritual mentor who helped me to stay on track with my meditation practice. I recommend finding a mentor who you can trust, resonate with, and feel that they can offer great value. Use your judgment to avoid scams and cons.I truly believe, when you can find that inner stillness within, you touch a dimension that heals and uplifts you in ways that is unfathomable.While Science is still catching up on understanding its limited view of reality, why not try something that is totally risk free and achievable that is well within your own control.Also, don't give up too easily. Just like anything worth while in life, your peace and joy is worth some persistence. And one more thing, Don't compare my result to yours. YMMV as You get what you need, not what I or someone feels. When you start the journey, do drop your judgments, go with an open mind and pure intention.I wish everyone could feel the peace and joy that I have found through meditation. Because to have a changed world, you need to be a changed person from within.Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.#mentalhealth #meditation #spirituality",,8/8/2023,9,220,7,Others,Anxiety

I was working remotely, and over one year ago, I moved to Mallorca (Spain) with her. I followed her lifestyle with her friends and joined her activities, but I couldn't continue.Mallorca was her dream place. She found a great job as an Architect with amazing projects because many millionaires like to build their retirement houses there. But on my side, I couldn't live there anymore. It was impossible to connect with people like me (SWE). I tried to go to a coworking place, but everyone was there for just a couple of weeks. The vacational environment reduced my productivity. The weather was SO hot that I quit the gym and any other sport I liked. My physical and mental health started to get worse and worse.After giving everything I had, spent a lot of money and trying to adapt to a place where I didn't feel I fit in, I decided to break up and move from Affirm (Spain remote) to Google (on-site Poland), where my father lives. I don't have friends here in Europe. I'm from LATAM. And that's why I wanted to go back to an office to meet people like me that at least I know are not going to leave the city for a while. Also, I feel I will live in a place where I can be more productive and build a good routine.However, I can't stop thinking about her.

For example, she knows I am unhappy and stressed at my current job. She sees me preparing very hard for interviews and she will make comments like, ""You are ruining my summer. We are not doing anything "". While this may sound innocuous, I have always been supportive of my wife in her career and her side hustles. I have invested in her side hustle. I took care of the kids when things were hard for her. She's ruined a lot of my summers in the past. I never said anything. I take care of 80% of the finances including 100% of mortgage and car payments. She minimizes my role in the family at every occasion. I'm not saying she does not do anything.

It was a high stress day for me at work and I snapped. I raised my voice and when that didn't work, I walked away. Now she is not talking to me.

I thought they were making fun of me, because that’s what my bullies used to do.

I came to the realization that I was pretty good looking. I was pretty ecstatic, a lifelong insecurity was crushed, and I lived pretty happily for a couple years, taking advantage of knowing women were initially attracted to me. I learned game, and was easily pulling.However, one day I started feeling empty. I shrugged it off. But then it kept coming back, months later, then weeks, then it became constant. I felt no real connection to anyone in this world. All the people who cared about me, I blew them away. I never really cared about others, and when people realized that, of course they didn’t want to be close to me anymore.I can easily pull off an act to make quick friends or get dates, but I can’t maintain it for very long.

It said that as a teenager, most of the basic needs were already taken care of by my parents, so I was able to focus on stuff like Self-Esteem and Self-Actualization. It’s normal for young adults to drop down to basic needs and it’s a healthy part of becoming a *self-sufficient* human being. It also mentioned that just because a level is higher on the pyramid doesn’t make it better or more meaningful; the most meaningful one is just wherever you are - getting shelter is more meaningful and will bring more happiness to a homeless person than self-actualisation.

Snowflake,bilsajf,PSA: Get your thyroid levels checked. - My Story,"Male, 36 here. I have been athletic and active all my life.From mid-2019, my energy suddenly crashed. I became mentally sluggish, irritable, and easily agitated. I found myself overthinking, generally feeling fearful and constantly worrying. It felt like a switch had been flipped in my body. I felt less confident, hesitated a lot, stopped taking initiatives, and felt like shit. Gradually, it started affecting my social life. Friends stopped inviting and eventually stopped contacting. Dating life went to shit. Physically, I gained 30 pounds, lost quite a bit of muscles, and probably aged like 10 years. Covid restrictions worsened my state, too.Initially, my primary did basic labs (CBC, CMP, and vit-D). My Vit-D was borderline, so she blamed the deficiency as root cause. However, fixing the deficiency did not fix my symptoms, so I was referred to a psychologist for possible GAD or Depression. Psych cycled through few medicines. However, none helped completely. I had given up and accepted my state as fate.Earlier this year, I moved cities, due to which I had to change my primary doc. New primary immediately ordered a hormone panel. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (TSH - 5.9). And was put on levothyroxine. 3 weeks later, I felt like like my old self again. Now (5 months later), my energy is back, my mind feels clearer, and there is 0 anxiety and no overthinking. No irritation. I feel like talking to people again. Have made new friends, started dating. Also lost 12 pounds. Why did I get hypothroidism ? Found out my father had it, too. So it's hereditary.TL;Dr: My mental health related symptoms were due to hormone imbalance.

Most importantly, life felt like it had direction.Now, I recently broke up with my significant other from college. We looked like we were going somewhere, but as the relationship became more serious, we weren’t able to solve the new issues that come with additional responsibility.My job also felt like it was going somewhere. Too bad the financial markets disagreed. After suffering 40% layoffs, with both my managers getting cut, I was teamless, so it was me next.But here’s the thing.Unlike most people after I was laid off I still have a job. It’s not a good one though. I’m working part time for the government, and the tc is literally 1/10 of my previous tc.And this is the real issue. Sometimes I feel down, but I almost cannot let myself feel sorry or ask for help. I always feel like at least I have a crappy job. Some people have no job. People drown in the sea to arrive in America. People in Africa are starving etc.I guess I just want some emotional support, and some advice from my fellow blindersFrom senior blind people.I was raised to be very strong and independent so it’s even embarrassing to ask for that.I hope you take this seriously.

I’ve been trying to be tough for her but harbored this suspicion that maybe it was too much for her.Now I’m at this stage now wanting to be more truthful to my own feelings and showing up for myself more.

She tries to belittle me in meetings by suggesting things opposite to what I suggest. In the beginning I would respect her and agree to her opinion because of her tenure but now I just see it being a problem because it’s too unnecessary.She would invite everyone around me for lunch but would not ask me. She would make fun of me if I don’t know something but then one of her work friends says that even he doesn’t know about that so she will make a puppy face.She stalks me literally everyday. I see that she checks out my LinkedIn profile everyday and also, she is always staring at me. She always tries to read my messages on my phone. She is making me feel like an outlier and I have started hating her.I have started hating going into work.

L3Harris Technologies,ILikeWLB+$,"I have a good life now on paper, but it's really a hot mess.","TL;DR I spend most of my time when I'm not working in bed, have missed a lot of work which finally led to a recent write-up, and have long been afraid to leave my house due to childhood and some adulthood trauma. That and religious differences with my spouse are the reasons why I can barely get out of bed unless drugged, and even then I still struggle. All this despite living the stereotypical American Dream of a house, family, and financial security.Sorry in advance for the long wall of text.I have a house and a family. My extended family does not live too far from me. But I am still a wreck.Grew up lower-middle class. Was bullied often and did not always fit in. My father was abusive to me and all the children at home (he's now an imprisoned and convicted sex offender) and my mother was totally complacent, mainly because she's an absolute buffoon for anything that's Christian and always believed/assumed the best of him over her own children. We were all raised Christian and Christian-schooled.Perhaps needless to say, I was woefully unprepared for the real world when I left my home and got married. I joined the Army and got honorably discharged as a disabled veteran. After moving back to my hometown, I became the victim of police brutality which led to my charges (speeding) getting dropped. Still, I have a good and what initially appeared to be stable job here.I've been diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and PTSD. I am on meds and seeing a psychologist monthly, but am in between therapists atm thanks to the VA. When I'm not at work, I'm mostly high (kratom) in bed watching TV or playing video games. My work has tried to accommodate me but we are reaching a breaking point because of how difficult it is for me to function on a daily basis. I'm on a hybrid schedule and am often late or call in sick during onsite days. I have used more (""unlimited"") sick time than probably anyone else there and finally recently got written up for it, though my own manager has also admitted that I perform well when I am present which I want to believe has kept me from getting fired up to this point.My spouse is Christian and I unconverted while in the military, which has naturally led to some friction. We have a child, who is honestly all I live for and I cannot imagine a life where I don't get to see my child as often.My anxiety often keeps me from leaving my house without being drugged up (kratom). Sometimes even that does not help. Even my love for my child often isn't enough to overcome my fear of leaving my house, which has led to further friction with my spouse.I have a few friends, but they are often busy with their own commitments. I'm not a TC chaser. More money doesn't help me feel better. Believe me, I've tried. I'm not going to do anything stupid, but I don't know how I'm supposed to live a good life.#depression #anxiety #ptsd #policebrutality",,7/30/2023,26,1304,4,Family Issue,Anxiety

Google,oHKo68,Does job/team switch ever get easier?,"I've switched companies about half a dozen times over my 15-year career so far, and almost every time the first few months (sometimes more) are pretty miserable. Mostly because I don't think I know at all what I'm doing and start doubting if I can be a good software engineer at all. Later it usually gets better and my performance ratings have always been consistently good.Most recently had a forced team switch far away (due to re-org) into a complex domain that I honestly have little interest in, and half a year into that I still feel like I know nothing and have pretty much lost patience with myself and no longer feel like I can fake it, so getting ready to call it quits and switch to something that I hope will be a better match for my skills/interest. But I already know that the new job will most likely feel harsh too for awhile; can only hope that it will be a little bit better than current and eventually things will start feeling smooth.Just wondering if this is a typical experience for others as well when switching jobs/teams, or if some of you have a good time in new jobs from the start, and how to get there... to me it seems like this is actually more of a problem the more seniority I accumulate due to increased expectations...",,8/5/2023,2,314,3,Job Issues,Others

Square,dillpickl,You will never be happy,"It is not possible to be “happy”. It is biologically impossible to be happy all the time, because of how the dopamine circuit is set up. There will always be something that makes you unhappy. Even as king of the world, the slightest annoyance will feel unbearable. Hence why billionaires tend to be arseholes. But look no further than your life progression:Low TC. High TC but job insecurity. High TC and safe but hate your job. Like your job but no friends. Friends but single. Married but fighting. Married and not fighting, but can’t conceive. Can conceive, but kids make you miserable. Kids are Ok, but not smart/applied enough. Kids smart but don’t love you. Love you but they’re bullied at school. Kids not bullied at school but get the feeling that you’d be better back home with more family.Stop trying to be happy. Keep pushing, but make peace with unhappiness.Edit 1: it’s incredibly attractive to find scapegoats to attribute your unhappiness to. I’m discontent but it’s because of X, Y, Z. Once that’s solved then I will finally be happy. It’s attractive because it means that you’re not happy because of something external, not your own fault. This is the mistake.Edit 2: if you start to make some real money, avarice becomes its own boss. When you find you can afford a bigger house and various luxuries, you naturally are drawn to them, but then you find you have to work harder and longer to maintain all of your luxuries and you are no longer on easy street. You are no longer secure. Luxury is not the best part of having money- security is the best part of having money.",,7/23/2023,37,1349,82,Family Issue,Others

Square,xjdockfjhw,Complete burnout. What to do?,"Think I've hit rock bottom with this. I hate my job so much I get panic attacks even thinking of it. I hate every single detail about it for many reasons, and I don't think it's reversible.So I've been brainstorming my options. I need to pick one with the least stress impact cause I can't take any additional stress anymore.Option 1. Change teams. Many of my trigger problems are associated with the team I'm in. I can potentially look for positions in other teams, but I'm super scared I'd be rejected because of insufficient contributions and poor feedback from my manager.Option 2. Push through and find another job. Even if I find a way to cope with interview stress, I am months away from being ready to succeed at interviews. Really rusty, and the current state of the market doesn't help.Option 3. Take a long break/FMLA. This would entail returning to the same team after the break. And this is even worse than working with my team every day.Option 4. Leave and take a break. My privilege allows me to take significant time off without any visa and much financial concerns. The thing is, I've already done it last year, and it wasn't relaxing. I was not able to cope with feelings of weakness and worry about the resume gap, as well as worsening market state. I had to rush finding a job because of all of this, made a poor choice and got 0 rest.So obviously, the problem is in my head. I cannot see a good way out, it's like I'm trapped in a cage. So far, I've been choosing to continue as is, but as my mental state is declining, I don't think I have the capacity to carry on much longer. Therapy, yes, but my area has a great shortage of therapists, and despite trying many, I was only able to find those that give common sense advice straight from self-help books.What option you see as my best choice going forward, since I can't think rationally at the moment?

Amazon,xyWi88,"Please, just tell me I'm going to be alright.","Seriously, right now I need just that. Because:- I'm a SDE2 at AWS in my mid-30s, and I have never been a manager/principal SDE/director/VP/whatever, although I have circa 15 YoE- My TC is about 220K CAD, with base pay being about 160K CAD, and it makes me cry when I hear about the wages in Seattle, let alone the Bay Area- I have the 3rd manager in 2+ years, and my current manager is new to the company (just over 1 year of tenure), and they aren't super excited about helping me with the promo – not that they don't like me, it's just as if they were overloaded with something else and not willing to drive the process/put actual effort into it- My team, although a part of an important and popular AWS product, is very very internal, we don't do sexy customer facing features making headlines, although we do tons of customer investigations/tickets which, while are absolutely necessary and important to the customers, certainly don't add much to your promo material, and neither do quite involved oncall shifts that affect my sleep and crush WLB (mine is routinely from evening to 2-3AM)- Our family which is me, my wife and our toddler child, has moved to Vancouver, BC 2+ years ago, and cost of living here is such that we have negative cash flow each month, not factoring in the RSUs [*]- My contract with Amazon certainly does not permit moving somewhere cheaper while retaining the job, although I could ask being transferred to Seattle- My family's Canadian PR process is stuck it seems as our application has got no visible updates for over 8 months now, and after 2 years on the work permit our time here doesn't count towards citizenship anymore- I'm Russian, and of course that horrible war raging right now tears my soul apart, not just because of the people dying and lives shattered on the both sides, but also since my home country chose to play USSR once again, and, although sometimes I think about returning, I see clearly that the place I would return to would not be the same as I left it- I don't know what is going to happen to my marriage in the long term since I am the only one providing for the family, and my wife is basically full time mom, and I try to help her as much as I can, so we're stressed/tired most of the time. During the last year or so, we've had sex 3 or 4 times maybe. It just doesn't feel right to me although I _think_ she's fine with that- My wife doesn't work and I doubt she will [**]- We don't really have friends or family in Canada, it's notoriously hard to make new friendships in Vancouver/Canada in general, and family/remote work/recent pandemic surely don't help in that realm- I really don't have an opportunity to learn fancy stuff like AI/ML/crypto/whatever everyone is so hyped about. Nope, I don't waste my time on tiktok/instagram/twitter/FB instead, I simply don't use anything from that list.- I have very little knowledge of the finance and investing, although I've learned some things about TFSAs/RRSPs/ETFs/GICs and taxation over the last couple months- I feel like I'm basically late for pretty much anything, be it successful career (I'm in my mid-30s already, and I'm just SDE2 LMAO), or building some equity, or at least saving for retirement, or ""simply!!!"" buying a home- Despite all that, I'm working my arse off at my current team, hopefully to get promoted to SDE3 in the '24 Q1, and to try to apply to principal SDE positions somewhere else after that, since I hope to have my PR by then. I just don't have 10 more years to grind myself over trying to being promoted to principal at Amazon, especially given my manager and my team – e.g. we have one and only L7 SDE in my L8 manager's org, and that L7's tenure is 13 years, they got promoted less than a year ago- As mentioned earlier, currently cash flow in my checking account is negative month to month, that is, we spend more than I earn in base salary. So currently our life is kind of countdown either till the moment when we'll have to start burning my savings (my wife has zero), or till I'm promoted, or till I change jobs. Tick tock.Is it just me wanting it all way too soon while being a relatively recent immigrant? Or am I really screwed, and am moving towards miserable, unhappy, and financially poor old ages with unclear perspectives on my family and marriage, because I was unlucky enough to make important decisions on a shitty moment and to immigrate from an economically underdeveloped country to a country where so many people struggle to make ends meet financially?All I want is to feel that what I do know will count/pay off in the future, that I still have something ahead of me besides endless daily chores, stress, and responsibilities, that I'm actually good at what I do, that I'm not going to end up in the gutter, and, last but not least, that I'm either loved mutually or just am alone and not hurting anyone. Because right now I doubt so many my life choices – from career to finance to marriage.Yes, it has been some whining, but I just needed to put it all together, even if just for myself. And no, I'm not going to feed this to ChatGPT for you :3[*] No, we don't live luxury life, we don't travel (just been to Cancun once in these 2+ years) and we rent well below the current market price making potential move senseless, it's just that after paying for rent, utilities, car insurance, our child's daycare (not even full-time), groceries, occasional eating out (nothing fancy, just to save time) 70 to 80 percent of my take home pay is gone, so it's basically impossible to save/invest[**] I'm not talking about the money even, I hope that at some point I will be able to provide for all of us routinely. It's more about her personally, that is, where her choices are leading her and what kind of person she is going to become down the line. I mean, when you do some work you see the value in, you kinda get stronger, more resilient and confident, both by achieving something and by interacting with other people, while she, it seems sometimes, is not just fit for life that well – be it her soft skills, or ability to endure stress, or to commit to anything besides child care, self care, and keeping fit#family #career #uncertainty #future",,7/18/2023,157,8694,58,Family Issue,Stress

I didn’t even go on leave, but the note was there.I’m pretty sure that’s why I failed to get the role. They don’t give you any indication, but I’m certain I passed all the other screenings - but only failed after the interview with the psychologist, after which he had me sign a waiver to obtain my medical history.The only other possible exclusion criteria is that my dad works in a similar role for another country (a friendly country though).The government is probably the only employer that’s allowed to demand your medical records btw (in the name of national security), so if you don’t want a career in a fed agency it might not apply to you. But if it does, know that all gov agencies might share information. Being rejected by one can affect other defence gov job applications, at least where I am.It’s best to leave a stressful job in a way that doesn’t burn any bridges of this sort, if you can.

Could you advise a Book or something dedicated to this topic, how to understand the nature of motivation and aging.I’m in early 30sTC 200",200000,8/4/2023,3,102,,Burnout,Burnout
New,d4vinci,Toxic manager having a heavy mental toll. Anyone mentally check out?,"I started a new job about 4 months ago after being laid off for 3-4 months. Took a pay cut and also lateral move but nice to have a paycheck than nothing.However, after a month or two, I realized my manager is very toxic and it's been having a toll on my mental and physical health. They belittle me, micro-manage me and have gone out of their way to CC our SKIP and other team members to point out times where I am messing up. They say things like ""this is unacceptable, I could've done this in an hour"" and I have documentation that they exclude me from team events (have seen team dinners on the calendar and everyone invited but me, her direct). I've met with my SKIP and he is actually a genuinely cool person but it is difficult to bring up these problems with him because it will sound like I am complaining. Anyways, it has gotten so bad that I've had to start therapy but everyone including Blind offers the same advice: Leave.And I am looking but the market is brutal right now and would look weird after being here only 4 months .However, I am having panic attacks and stress about work and it is compounded by having work email and Slack on my phone. I have been off this past Thu-Fri and I am getting weekend emails from my manager saying my work is unacceptable and to set up meetings with them and SKIP to go over it. I finally just deleted the Mail app from my phone and tempted to just keep Slack right now. I put too much emotion into work and take things personally when she attacks me and I am ready to be an emotionless robot. #mentalhealth #stress #toxic",,7/31/2023,8,387,4,Toxic Manager,Stress

I think he also has ADHD & Control issues.Every time I send him a document for review, he nits picks something and suggests changes, even if they aren't value added and time consuming. Unlike our previous manager, this one controls the visibility and won't let us talk to directors or VPs. Our previous manager let us take charge and trusted our decisions but this one decides every single thing. Never asks us how we feel about his suggestions. Feels like we are just puppets now. I am TT yoy so personally it feels like an attack when someone starts correcting every single sentence I write. It makes sense for new projects, but not for something I've been doing for years.

Honeywell,amorFati!,Fragile self esteem,"I am from a middle-class South Indian family. Growing up, I was always average or below average in school and college. The constant comparison with other kids throughout my life has severely impacted my confidence. After completing my bachelor's degree, I obtained a low-paying job, but I quit after 8 months due to subpar social skills and a high-stress environment. The following few months until I pursued my master's were terrible; I felt low and questioned my self-worth. Everyone around me was in well-paying jobs, which made my parents feel dissatisfied and frustrated with me. Every remark from my family felt personal, leading me to believe that I was worthless if I didn't have a job or didn't meet society's earning standards.Shortly after those challenging months, I came to the US, completed my master's, and secured a decent job. However, whenever I hear news of layoffs, I feel terrified and worthless. I tied my self-esteem to my job, and sometimes I even contemplate ending my life. I know that getting laid off is beyond my control, but the thought that I'm not worthy enough to live if I don't earn enough or don't have a job is slowly consuming me. How can I change my mindset and improve my self-esteem so I don't end up feeling this way?

HCL,DUWO36,Let's talk about women/relationships.,"Warning: This might be long. I wrote it on desktop and am sure it looks even longer on the phone.Hello all. To be up front, this post is directed at all of the frustrated young guys that I see on here who seem to be genuinely suffering when it comes to their own self images and interactions with women. It is not meant to be inflammatory or judgmental, and the things I say of course won't apply to everyone. I'm basically throat-clearing here to say that you can take it or leave it, and if I can help just one guy here, this effort will have been worth it; I've been there, and know how it feels.About me - I'm 30. I grew up obese as a child in the American Midwest, few friends, and found it hard to even look at girls in the face for much of my life. I didn't even touch a girl (hold hands) until I was about 20. I viciously hated the way I looked for most of my life and women felt unobtainable. I had a very big moment when I was about 17, and realized that I really needed to change how I took care of myself physically. These details don't really matter, but I spent several years losing about 100 pounds and learned not to completely detest myself. Today, I am relatively muscular, but not even close to ""ripped"", and enjoy an active lifestyle including running, rock climbing, and weight lifting. Most people would say I do well with women, but we'll talk about that later.With that crap out of the way, I want to say something. It is truly amazing to me that this site attracts extremely motivated individuals who master complex skillsets, in some sense ""win"" the capitalist game by making more money than god, but still find women intimidating and relationships mysterious. If you can navigate creating a successful career, you absolutely can work at women as a skill. I genuinely believe that any guy who is open to it can ""work"" on women, or rather the idea of learning what they like, need, and enjoy in life, and creating themselves to literally be more like what women in general are attracted to.You may think to yourself: ""well that's so fake, a woman should love me for who I am, it's not natural to change myself and lose myself in that way"". I understand this hesitation. How fake can a person be, pretending to be someone else or something they're not? It feels like a deep lie. The truth, however, is that we are all simply the summation of how we comport ourselves in the world and think from moment to moment. So the thing to really sink your teeth into here is that: people can change, and do change. The mental image you have of yourself is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and other human beings can and will detect that and absorb it. This is why a lot of advice honestly boils down to ""fake it till you make it"". What that really means is that you need to genuinely reimagine what you are and who you are.Who are you? Really ask yourself and be honest. Have you ever been on a date and found the girl sitting across from you losing interest in you as you told her about your work? It's utterly deflating, right? Take some self-awareness: what do you come off as to other people? Does your first-date-Tinder-girl really want to hear you rant endlessly about your rock collection, or arcane knowledge about medieval history, for example? Those things are incredibly interesting, to be sure, but you really need some self-awareness on how *she* is feeling. I will definitely have more to say on that in a bit.A lot of guys are just so boring. You should never be boring. I don't know if there's much worse as a general principle of living. The world is incredible, and we all need to soak up every last bit of life that we can. We can take that amount of life and infuse and share it with other people. Doesn't that sound exciting? What else is the point of life if not to share beautiful moments with other people whom we love and are loved by, surrounded by music and food and laughter? I know some guy is reading this thinking 'oh so I have to act like a comedian or a clown or performer'. No.This is the meat of what I really mean with this whole rant of mine. Make yourself more interesting. Visit a museum, learn something. Put yourself in an uncomfortable situation. Try to experience something. Embrace feeling sad, or elated, or confused. Read great literature. Pretend to be a guy that does those things for a while. Life is about our interactions with other people. You need to learn to care about other human beings, genuinely. An old guy on a park bench probably has some really cool stuff to say (or he might not!), maybe you should try caring about him. If you try volunteer work, which you should, you will meet so many amazing human beings. People who have been broken, others who have come back from the brink, others who have lost in the fight against life itself. You need to stop waiting for other people to stop talking so that you can say things that you think make you sound interesting or funny. Drop your ego. You might not be that interesting, and that's okay. So just listen more. Listen to people, and take a real and active participation in what they are saying. Don't you know that every person is the hero of their own story, and their own moment? When they share with you, you can listen, and learn, and actually care about them. Practically speaking, this might boil down to: listen and actually take genuine interest in them.A huge point that I need to make here is that this applies to everyone. Old, young, man, woman, rich, poor. When you have the ability to bring people into your orbit, share a genuine sense of place with them, and affect them, you will draw people, including women, to you. You won't have to try. When you reach out into the world making real connections with all people, you will quickly realize that all of the ""game"" you use on crappy dating apps has been such a gross misuse of your time, and that you will have better women in your life completely organically, while also being a better person and friend. Not that dating apps are inherently bad, but for frustrated guys on the internet they might as well be is a good starting point. I could launch a tangent about how I think for 99.99% of men dating apps are a waste of time, but maybe I'll save that for another moment.Don't worry, on the downhill slope now. Almost done with the rant.I mentioned earlier that women generally run more on ""feelings"" than guys do. This is not right or wrong, good or bad. Women love sex, but they love feeling comfortable and being able to be who they really are even more (doesn't everybody?). A girl should feel safe around you, like you are in control of the situation, and they generally flourish. My favorite analogy of this has always been that girls are the ""first mate"" and you are the ""captain"" of the ship. There's nothing more attractive than a guy who has his own direction, interests, and thrust in life. This doesn't mean that you don't cater to or care about your first mate, even a whole lot, but if you cling to her axiomatically, that's generally not a good look. If you can disarm women by making them feel comfortable and not judged around you, that is one of the best abilities you can ever have. I get away with saying things that are semi-offensive or look bad on paper, but women feel totally safe around me, so don't feel attacked or offended. As a throw away example: I've basically never had my gf drive the car wherever we go, and we do long roadtrips a lot. (She is a fine driver, but it makes me more comfortable to be in control of the situation and I'm a very safe and conservative driver. It's not like I angrily force her out of the driver's seat--I just prefer it.) So I tell people in mixed company at like a bar that I don't 'let' my women drive and the result I always get is: ""that's kind of hot"", or at the very least ""yeah that makes sense"". Not: ""you're a disgusting a$$hole, how dare you!"". I communicate clearly and calmly and they sense that I'm not looking to stir any pots, I'm just being myself. Stupid example, but the point is you never want girls being on guard around you. That's a recipe for disappointment.One last throwaway thought. Stop doing coffee or dinner dates, they are so lame. Sitting across from a stranger spending money trying to impress them is honestly hell for me. Do something, anything active, you will have SO much more success. I'm going to arbitrarily stop here because I know this is so long. I'm sure there's plenty of people that will disagree with my pontificating, and that's totally welcome. Happy to answer questions. We need conversation and positivity in this world.I just want you guys to learn to love yourselves, and be interested in yourselves. You are beautiful and deserve good relationships in your life. It might take some work, but you'll only be better for it.TC: $60k",,7/18/2023,93,2471,32,Family Issue,Sad

I actually love what I do and I don't feel under stress at Work- overtired is also something that I could relate too as I do train hard sometimes- I always end up taking a camomile with melatonin to fall asleep and right after I drink it sensation goes away- I will talk to a doctor thanks to your comments.

Instead, I'm nothing more than a cog in a gargantuan machine, churning out code for insignificant services that the general public doesn't even know exist, let alone care about.And on the rare occasion someone does interact with what I've slaved over, they remain blissfully ignorant of the blood, sweat, and tears poured into its creation.Just think about it for a moment. This job is the epitome of abstraction. Day after day, I find myself trapped in front of a soul-sucking screen, whether it's the cold walls of a cubicle or the suffocating isolation of my room.

Snowflake,gNbH22,Husband complaining my parents of not sponsoring us,"Both my husband and I are SDEs and we graduated from the same school, but he started working a few years earlier than me since I did my PhD and quit. Before we got married we are together for 2 years but not in the same city, and I moved to his apartment right before our marriage.His parents paid the down payment for our current home and sent money to him every year, while he keeps his money in investments. The house was purchased while I was still in school and it’s under his name. We are financially separated and I paid for food and other expenses. Now we plan to move to a SFH and he asked if my parents can sponsor us, since his parents has already bought a home for him, I rejected and insisted 50/50 on the new home. But he doesn’t want to take his money out of investment and pressured me everyday, and he said it would be « unfair » if he paid down payment and mortgages with me since he let me stay at his home for free for several years.How should handle this situation?#depression #burnoutJust to clarify:1. I pay for food and other expenses while I live with him, and the cost is more than what I spent when I rent & live alone, and I moved to the current city for the marriage. I used to live in a better city with great job and friends and family, and I only need to pay 25% of my salary to rent a luxurious condo and everything else is cheaper.2. I wanna split the SFH cost 50/50 but husband want me and my family to pay 100% since he has our current condo which his parents gifted him and paid the mortgage.3. My income is fine but not good enough to afford a SFH on my own in the bay, a townhouse is probably okay but my husband said it won’t appreciate so it’s bad investment.4. My question is if he points are acceptable in different cultures since my Chinese friends could be biased.5. In no way I will ask my parents to pay, but my husband brings that up everyday and said his parents sacrificed a lot for us bla-bla-bla, and insisted my parents should do the same, which leads to big fights all the time. And he mentioned he paid the mortgage all the time to make me feel guilty, which is even more unacceptable.

Doctors suspected schizophrenia initially but then decided to hold on the diagnosis part until he sees more episodes which he did not. He holds a govt job in India and is doing well. At least thats what I felt all these years. He has 2 grown up kids in their teenage. He was a bit anxious when I recently visited him. He shared that over the last few years he is getting increasingly worried about the future of himself and kids. He read articles on internet that these illnesses start late teenage mostly. The eldest is in that age range and we don’t see any problems with the kids at all. They are happy and doing well with studies. I guess he is very afraid to see his children suffer (if at all they even get it). The other reason for his worry is that he has been on medications for 10+ years. I don’t think it has impacted him in a negative way but he still fears some long term side effects he read on the internet. I read the same and I guess there is some truth to it but we can’t generalize it given the fact that it has helped him be stable for such a long time.Is there anyway I can give him some comfort. Anyone who has any success stories that I can share ? Also do these medications really have long term impact ? I mean he has been on it for 10 years and is fit overall for his age. He runs half marathons twice a year and exercises daily. I also read some posts on fb pages that says people have been on meds for 20+ years without life threatening effects.

Microsoft,thisok,Guide me,"Hello all. This is not a ranting post really but it is a little bit depressing post. I am single guy around 30, living in NewYork area. I live alone in a beautiful city and work in big tech company.But somehow I am not happy with the life. I came from India 5years back with big academic and career dreams, I have achieved it now somewhat, but in this 5 years, I have lost some close family member in covid time and also, my friends are getting disconnected as time passes by.This year my planned arrange marriage failed and there is no new progress in that direction too. I visited India few months back this year and it was just mental hammering from everyone there. My family and relatives were just judging me about failed marriage and pressured me to come back to India. Mu family has already made me villain and think I enjoy my life here and ignore them, which absolutely not true.I was nerd growing up and was never good with girls, so I do not think I can be good at dating and finding partner by my own. And also, I do not think I have thing in me to impress someone.Now I feel lonely, sad, angry all the time, and dream about past good times in India which I feel I will never have again. Addition to that, this rolling layoffs environment in my company this year has totally destroyed me mentally and I am loosing confidence that if I ever get laid off, I will able to find a good job and life again. My family blames me that I do not have a good handsome personality (hence no good relationship will happen with me) and I am too focused on career only and ignoring family and responsibilities.I came from low middle class and conservative family so only thing I knew growing up that why good education, career and money is important and that will give good life and respect in society. And now I feel I am getting blamed for that from my family and I feel that is totally unfair. They were the one, who forced me for this career path. I know going back to India is probably best thing for my mental health but I can not do that at this point (maybe in 2-3 years, I will do it) as I have financial responsibilities for present and future and I am not sure I am senior enough or junior enough to get well paying job in India. Also, I know I should invest myself in some hobby but I am too depressed to find hobby or go somewhere. I already lost interest in some hobbies I had.Please advise me if someone has gone through it or seen someone going through this mental hell. And please not try not to judge me and criticize. I am my own biggest critic anyway and I blame myself for all of this enough. I am loosing my confidence every day, becoming angry and now I feel, I am not comfortable staying in crowds, family functions and groups. I was happy, confident, friendly and mindful soul before coming here and I would like to be that person again.#depression #mentalhealth #burnoutYoe- 5Tc- 230 k",,7/29/2023,9,577,3,Indians Issue,Burnout

All those late nights working to please management wasn’t worth it. I have sacrificed a lot of my social life for this job and it’s not like I’m getting any younger.

So, I’m leaving the Bay Area rat race behind. I sold my car and all my belongings, and my last day at work is in two weeks.

Meta,OFoJ54,A Fable,"There’s a Jewish fable my mom told me as a child and I’d like to share it here. There’s a point I promise.There was a town in Poland called Chelm and the people in Chelm were considered to be a town of fools. One of the women in the town made the best latkes in the village. (Latkes are a potato pancake made for Hanukkah). Another family the man was sad that his wife’s latkes were nowhere near as good as this neighbor woman. So one day he stood outside her window and watched her make the latkes and wrote down every step. He brought the recipe home so he and his wife could make the latkes that were so good. At every step in the recipe, the wife would object and say “no that’s wrong, you can’t do it this way. This is the correct way to do it” and she would take over and do it the way she was used to. At the end the latkes were the same latkes that he always ate from his wife. He resigned himself to the fact that that was just how they were made and there was nothing to be done.I see a bunch of posts about how difficult immigration and other types of assimilation are. But when people share their experiences and tips for improving, they are met with hostility. If you aren’t willing to change your ways or even acknowledge there is a different way to do things, nothing will change. There are things beyond your control and it is a hard thing to do to change your habits but you cannot expect a different result if you don’t make an attempt.",,7/20/2023,23,395,20,Family Issue,Sad

I started to research more about it and eventually found a lot of comfort in spirituality, occidental teachings, yoga, meditation, etc. I somehow accepted my mortality and moved on with life.Just a few weeks ago while researching about quantum physics, I had a realization of something I’ve known for a long time. We all know we are made of atoms and that atoms are the building blocks of the universe. Somehow, for some reason when researching quantum physics, I had a realization that everyone and everything is a bunch of atoms just coupled together by physical forces.Somehow, someway, that gave me a panic attack, made me feel derealized, made me feel scared of death again. Somehow, I ended up feeling lost, anxious, questioning the meaning of life and existence.I have to be honest, I’m not in therapy anymore and I have not taken cbd in a long time, all because I thought I was doing fine for the past year. thought I was able to manage my anxiety and today I feel like I haven’t.Today I feel like I went back to the dark whole and it is coming back to get me.I’m continuously afraid of death, feeling derealization and anxiety for the past 2 weeks.

I’m an engineer but I feel more like an analyst, reading and writing endless documents that nobody will care, work feels artificial, like we invented stuff to be busy all the time and leadership always have a justification on how is all connected but I have this feeling that my work here is meaningless and nothing matters.Third quarter just started and I’m already burned out, it’s so emotionally and mentally draining to pretend I like my job and my manager is noticing it, I can’t keep with the lie anymore.

Google,QmgN86,How to have healthy conversation with wife?,"Every time there’s any discussion or debate on topics of differing opinion, she says I’m controlling. I’m not even sure how to have a healthy conversation without those accusations.Recently she bought about $600 worth of pots and pans which I said ok because she said it’s life time guaranteed.Not too long after, our bedsheets ripped so I went to amazon to buy a $20 one. She asked me the quality and # of threads. I said idk so I said she can pick and buy.She ended up choosing a $100 bedsheet so I said why so expensive? She said it’s already 50% off and good material. So I said why would we spend $100 on a bedsheet that’ll rip in a few years again.Thus she got angry and called me controlling.This is definitely not the first time and I’m not even sure how to have a healthy conversation with her. If I try to explain to her, she’ll think it’s manipulation.As someone who genuinely cares about financial independence, it’s important to develop a balance of frugality and splurge. Because it’s a balance thing there is no distinct line. So disagreement is inevitable.

Square,ooooff,People stopped reaching out,"I came to the US about 5 years ago through work. I didn't have any friends here except my spouse, but met a few great people at work, and we started hanging out. Then COVID hit, and social interactions became minimal. I also changed my job to a fully remote one and never clicked with anyone on my new team.Last year, I had to get through a really traumatic event that is still lingering, and I realized that, besides having my partner with me, I'm all alone. I tried reaching out to my pre-COVID friends, but noticed that they interacted with me only if I proactively reached out, which was becoming increasingly hard since my mental health had gone down the drain. Some of them moved and we lost connection, some didn't have much shared context outside our work, some seemingly had used me as a venting tool and disappeared after their lives improved. Anecdotally, most of them experienced changes to the better after the pandemic had ended (promotions, weddings etc), while I was going through much darker times.I became very depressed and burnt out because of personal and work issues, and just didn't have the strength to continue reaching out and trying to salvage the remnants of social connections I had, even though I wanted it. Partly it was also because of COVID, I'm socially anxious, and isolation time really degraded my skills. As I expected, no one really bothered to reconnect, or the connection quickly died.I feel stupid and useless , like I'm turning into this anti-social monster no one wants to be around, and I don't quite understand what went wrong. I'm really thankful to have my spouse's support, but it's not enough. I always tried to be a considerate and caring friend, and I thought people appreciated it, but guess I was doing something really wrong. What's worse, I can't really invest into new relationships now, I barely have enough strength to do my work.

I even fought with somebody when they tried to ruin my husbands reputation in an open gathering. I have not fought with anybody other than my husband before. I’m not comfortable with my group of friends anymore. I feel like they bring down my morality and positivity after every meet. So I try and avoid meeting them over the weekends. Now I have reached a stage where I feel like I don’t have friends and I have started feeling very lonely. But making friends as adults is proving to be a very hard task these days. My husband says my filter to make friends is pretty rigid and we won’t be able to find friends if I have high standards.There have been a lot of life changes recently. We bought our first home a couple of months ago. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression and I was burnt out at work before I lost my job as part of the recent layoff wave. I had to work extra hard to interview due to my mental health issues. I have finally found another job and will be joining a new company in the next few days. Personally, I’m not happy with the company, but in a tech market like this and with visa issues, I am trying to accept my situation. But I ended up taking a down level in role and about 40% pay cut. So I have started feeling like I am lagging behind in my career.Amidst all this, I underwent a surgery and my mother in law flew in to take care of us. The recovery post surgery made me very dependent on my family for my own work as well. I feel very guilty about that. Now after a few weeks, I’m finally able to get back on my feet and start helping out in household chores.With all these changes, I feel the need to develop patience and mental resilience to a larger extent. I feel like a very changed person over the past 5 years. I’m not sure if this is common during adulting.

Sage,gitops00,Coming to terms with being an introvert--,"Been heavily introverted since high school -- really into books, games, math/science, and found socializing uncomfortable at school and work situations perhaps due to feelings of rejection or insecurity. Feel the world is designed for groups and couples -- going out in public makes me self-conscious -- like to a museum or sport games by yourself is not fun.Get tired of getting take out food all the time and not enjoying the company of other people. This has made dating challenging, since in my opinion the game favors extroverts and an outgoing personality. What I hate about socializing is how cliquey people can be and won't give you a chance really if you are not like them. I shared my feelings with mental health professionals but they dont just get it -- or understand my situation. They put the blame on me -- on times I used cannabis for anxiety and I don't drink really. Tired of advice to ""put yourself out there"". I play sports and exercise -- but do most things on my own and feel like I'm missing out on something in life. Maybe I'm stubborn or rigid or something -- but havent been able to accept myself. I get tired ""masking"" my symptoms and pretending to be someone I'm not for the sake of coolness or fitting in. Tried a lot of things but I'm not good at keeping relationships with people and understanding social situations that other people get intuitively -- I've been using Chat GPT as a tool for therapy since I'm so done dealing with BS and dealing with egos when seeking mental health care and the whole insurance medical-industrial complex.

They are much farther from any potential IPO/exit event that my recruiter made out to be and their culture is extremely top-down which I have not really dealt with so far in my career.The problem with my old manager was a lack of recognition for my work and openly being biased towards certain people in the team. One thing he was not was a micro manager. He trusted me from day one and gave me the space to learn and grow and I absolutely enjoyed my work there. Not once did he doubt me or show any lack of trust or respect. The biggest reason I left my job was the fear of layoffs at Meta and I wanted to get ahead of anything that could have happened.At my startup here, after the first couple of weeks, my manager has been giving me petty and nit-pick feedback that is obvious to anyone. I've onboarded several people myself at my previous jobs and I'd never give such feedback to anyone. Everyone starting a new role takes a few months to settle in. I feel this manager wants to assert some kind of dominance over me and literally points out every single thing I do differently from what he's used to.I feel strongly that he's gaslighting me, I'm here questioning my own ability and if I should even continue to be a software engineer or if it's really my fault. He's constantly comparing me to others in the team and even said the others in the team are probably exceptionally talented which is why they onboarded quicker. I've never had managers compare me to others in the team ever before.I had my 3-month review and my peer feedback was extremely positive while my manager feedback was neutral -negative at best, again pointing out the most petty things as something I need to improve on, while conveniently not mentioning any of the good work I've done so far.Lately, he's been bringing up my probation period multiple times a week and trying to micromanage everything I do. He meets with me multiple times in a day to ask about the status of my tasks and it's exhausting having your manager have zero trust you will deliver something. I've never had this experience even when I was fresh out of college in my first job.I feel like I've made a big mistake with the move.

He said he won’t mind if I live next to him and date other guys.I really like that apartment and I know it’s really hard to come by that good deal as I have been looking for months. But I still hesitate because of its proximity to his apartment. Other apartments that fit my needs are all way above my budget. I plan to live in this apartment only for a year.Is it okay if I live there only for a year? Will it make it hard for me to move on? Or should I live in another place even though it’s above my budget (+$400/month more)? Would there be any issue with my dating life if I live there? Would my future bf be okay with this (and do I have to tell him or not necessary)?",,7/11/2023,34,1476,5,Others,Others
Amazon,bYtq02,Amazon is damaging my brain,"I am concerned about my mental health. The work style at Amazon is damaging my brain. I am over 40 and cannot stand constant context-switching and multitasking, especially during on-calls. I became sluggish, found it hard to concentrate, and noticed memory loss. Maybe I had those symptoms before, but this company worsened them. I see how much younger teammates are way better than me at multitasking. It drains my mood and self-esteem.I have sessions with a psychologist once a week, and it really helps. Curious about FMLA. Will it put me into focus if I take FMLA?

Also I sense that they are not comfortable leaving the country they grew up in. Is there a possibility to maintain the validity of their green card if they are able to visit me in the US annually?What are my options ? Is it too late to cancel now and have them renew the tourist visa instead ? Would I be able to get a refund from USCIS? It would you say pursue the green cards no matter what and have them come to US every year ?Update: Their tourist visa will expire in 2024. At this point they are fine with a tourist visa.

Microsoft,goodEngi,Any Recommended Psychiatrists Around Redmond/Bellevue Area?,"Hi all, sorry if it's a stupid question to ask, I did some research on psychiatrists available around me but the reviews usually have both positive and negative aspects, so it's hard for me to make a decision. For now I'm also going to leave a message to my primary care provider and see if they can provide some recommendation too. But meanwhile it would be great if I can get some recommendations from folks that have seen some local psychiatrists before.To provide some context:Lately, my depression has become increasingly challenging to manage due to some personal events that happened. It's mostly coming from work stress and some family situation, but it is affecting various aspects of my life, for example:1. Having constant fear about work and uncertainty in the future. Having racing heartbeats during work, etc.2. I started with eating too much, but now I would have no appetite for anything. The first 6 months since I switched to new employer, I gained about 20~30 pounds. Now it's the opposite - I would just somehow forget about having breakfast and lunch on a daily basis. Setting an alarm / reminder doesn't work for me somehow. My wife is aware of this situation and she decided to text/call me everyday to give me a reminder. (Not going to lie but I feel really ashamed about this, I feel like a big baby this way)3. Sleep disturbances. Sometimes work fear would keep me up all night. Most recently, I would be randomly thinking about upsetting past experiences nonstop.4. My emotional state is increasingly difficult to control. I noticed that I'm more easily irritated than ever, even by very small things. I was so angry one time that I just threw my phone away for no reasons.5. I have noticed a decline in my work performance. It has become challenging to focus on tasks, and I have lost interest in my job, making it difficult to perform at the level I once did6. While I don't have a specific plan, I have experienced an alarming increase in thoughts about self-harm. This is deeply concerning to me, and I recognize the urgency of addressing these distressing thoughts7. (and a thousand more other things...)...I've been attending therapy sessions from Spring Health for over a year now, and have definitely pointed out these issues before. But so far I don't find these sessions helpful - my therapist is a great listener and very caring, I've learnt all the coping skills, but it's hard to come up with a permanent solution for my specific situation. Last night I couldn't sleep again and felt the depression symptoms were kicking again, so I called the crisis support line, and they have suggested that I should consult with my primary care provider or a psychiatrist for further treatment, and get some assistance on applying short term disability leave.That's pretty much it. I just want to reach out to folks in Blind and get some recommended psychiatrists in the area, ideally if they have experiences helping out people from big tech companies like FAANG, etc, to apply for short term disability. I had some unpleasant experience applying for short-term disability with my previous employer before, the experience is very similar to some posts on Blind - application got denied, having no income for few months, and the appealing process was really frustrating which even worsen one's mental health condition. But likely I was doing it the wrong way: I was only working with a therapist before, while I guess psychiatrist would have better credibility on these matter.Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks a lot!#burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,7/27/2023,2,50,1,Family Issue,Stress

New,Misc...,"One week without cocaine, thanks to Blind","A little over a week ago I wrote a post about my struggles with cocaine.https://us.teamblind.com/s/NB4W0tgFWith the support and suggestions I received I finally summoned the strength to make a stab at it. The last time I used cocaine was Saturday, July 1st.Cocaine down the toilet (goodbye to about $160 of premo shit), dealer's info erased from my phone (made sure to clean out Venmo and Zelle this time), and a serious conversation with my wife asking for her support (she is being very supportive.)It was good timing as I had a 4 day weekend due to the 4th of July. Whoo boy did I need the extra days to adjust... After about 3 months of using about a gram a day every single day quitting hit me like a train. A sleepy train.So Sunday, Monday, and (especially) Tuesday I basically just slept. I would get up twice a day to eat and walk the dog, but as soon as I was done it was back to bed. The fatigue I felt was kind of scary to be honest. It felt like ""shit, I can either relapse and feel normal or feel tired _forever_""...But luckily by Wednesday I was able to.. kind of.. do my job. It's days like this last Wednesday that make me infinitely thankful that I am blessed to work remotely. Thursday was a little better still and then finally Friday I felt like I actually got an honest productive day's work done.I hope that I might be through the worst of it.So really, THANK YOU to the Blind community.

Meta,dtat7atoyu,I am terrified,"UPDATE: Please make sure you've tried Chat GPT 4 before commenting. Don't be cheap, it's just $20.The IQ of ChatGPT4 has been estimated to be around 180, and that is just the worst we can get. More and more companies are developing their own LLMs that will soon replace entry-level white-collar jobs. Soon, 90% of the jobs will be obsolete, leaving jobs opportunities only for super-skilled scientists.But that's not what scares me.Let's say the overlords of this planet decide to give us some kind of UBI and free time to do whatever we want (with some restrictions, of course). Suddenly we, the human race, will become the second most advanced species. We will be to the AI what a monkey or a dolphin is to us. What would be the meaning of life then? Why wake up every day? Why do anything if AI will always be better? Why solve problems that are already solved? Why work at all?I mean, we will be done. Our purpose will have been served.In the old days, when a new employee joined a company, it was usually because someone much older was retiring. Same with humans, we make our money, raise kids, and retire. Is it time to retire the human race?The only alternative I can see now is that various religious movements will catch up and people who are obsolete by this time will try to explain their being by some higher level meaning like a soul or a chance for an afterlife in paradise.That's not something new. In ancient times, after basic needs were met, people mostly focused on religion because modern achievements like an airplane or just a light bulb didn't exist. They didn't even know what our planet is, so their problems were divided between ""basic needs"" like food, shelter and ""magic"" or ""gods"" (everything else, including the Sun).#burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,6/27/2023,90,4866,24,Burnout,Burnout

Lyft,jgffsxx,Admitted to top 10 US undergrad but went to no-name college,"TL;DR It greatly compromised my life and I still feel that nothing can make up for it no matter how hard I work or what I achieve, and I’m unsure how to get over this.I was admitted to a top 10 US university for college that is sometimes ranked in the top 10 in the world. Instead, I went to a terrible US college that one has heard of, with a >50% admission rate and no engineering or CS programs at the time. The reason was that I had an academic scholarship to the terrible school and my dad insisted that I do it and that I had no choice. There was no data on graduate compensation at the time and my dad insisted that a $40k student loan would ruin my life, to quote him directly. I was 17 at the time and needed a parent’s signature on the loan paperwork, which they refused to provide. Unbeknownst to me, my parents already had a net worth of over $2M at that time (over 10 years ago) and could easily have paid for the top school. I was at the top of my class in my public high school with all of the hardest courses.How do I get over this? My dad still doesn’t admit that it was a mistake to this day, even though my parents later paid the same amount for my younger sister’s mediocre college that they would have paid for me to go to the top 10 university. My career got a late start from being a self-taught SWE and working my way through shit companies to better ones. My current manager went to the same top school for college that admitted me and is 3 years younger than me. They definitely deserve to be a manager but I feel like I deserve to be at a better place in my career by now. I have gone through a ton of unnecessary BS for my net worth to likely be half as high as it would otherwise be today due to lacking “smart” branding in my early career to open the right doors.More importantly, I never got the network or skills from the top school.

Slalom Consulting,HBUp54,Constant Negative Thoughts,"I've been grappling with persistent negative thoughts since the age of 13. I recognize that everyone occasionally experiences negativity, but the nature of my thoughts seems peculiar.Whenever I'm about to make a decision or take an action, a negative thought intrudes, often painting dire consequences. For instance, when I contemplate purchasing a new pair of shoes, my mind suggests that if I wear them regularly, I might break my leg. These thoughts are unending.In an attempt to evade these thoughts, I sometimes change my decision. However, the negativity doesn't cease, it merely shifts focus onto my new choice. Suppose I change my mind about buying shoes due to the intrusive thought and decide to buy a shirt instead, my mind then starts associating negative consequences with buying the shirt.Is there anyone who has experienced something similar? If so, how were you able to address or mitigate it?",,7/25/2023,3,142,1,Bullying,Others

eBay,nothing12,New mom. Judged and criticized even for smallest of things.,"I am a new mom who is just learning her way with her child. My mil visited us to help with baby care which she did but used to criticize me on basically everything I did with baby or otherwise. Being physically dependent on her I couldn’t speak my heart out and it built up lot of frustration in me. I don’t know if it qualifies as postpartum depression. The precious early months of my newborn which I should have spent happily bonding with my child, I spent going through her endless nonsensical shit. I think she just made her point very clear that she hates me. Once she left, all of the anger within me started coming out as she kept saying things even on phone call. I started having tiffs with my husband for the same as I didn’t feel heard when it came to his mother. He has unbeatable faith for his mother and always doubts me if I am being biased towards her. I don’t think he will ever understand what it is like to go through such a postpartum journey.Recently I noticed that he is doing the same things to me that my mil used to do. Being judgmental on every small thing he feels is not right and giving me a lecture on it. On the top of it, he approaches any argument very aggressively which means we can’t ever have any discussion without yelling at each other. He invalidates my feelings whenever I bring up this issue of he being judgmental and aggressive in arguments. He says that I am very sensitive and that I take offense in every small thing he says. I have tried my best to communicate how I feel about this entire situation but I don’t feel heard. It ends up with he behaving as a victim and walking away passing another harsh judgement on me.I don’t know if I will ever be able to get my point across without losing my mind as I have reached a point where any such judgement from him triggers me a lot and reminds me of all the things his mother did with me in my postpartum journey. I feel totally helpless. Sometimes I even get thoughts of whether we are good for each other and if we should get separated but I do love him and he is a nice person otherwise. I just feel it is his way of getting back at me for the hatred I feel for his mother.I have zero mental peace and just living somehow. I don’t have anyone I can share my feelings with because if he comes to know that I have told anyone about all this he will probably be very mad which would mean more of such behavior from him or would shame me in front of his family with my families secrets.I feel very alone in life. Total loser. I can’t even share this with my parents as they are old and probably would ask me to try and keep harmony.

#ReadyForWork,hK8$aw,What did I do wrong with my life and how to fix it,"(Need advice)I’m a girl from a small town in my home country, came to the US 5 years ago.I was supposed to have a stable boring government job in my hometown, very low pay but never have to worry about layoffs. I was a pretty young girl and my parents planned to find for me a rich husband and expected me to become a good traditional wife, just like thousands of other girls in my hometown did...But soon after several years, I felt bored at my job and the low pay. I felt that I could do better, that I didn’t want to be a traditional wife and dependent on a rich husband,... that I wanted to explore the world,... I rejected many good guys because I wanted to focus on my dream first....I decided to go out of my comfort zone and did something that no one in my social circle did at that time: took a $70k loan to pursue a MS degree in the US. At the time I was busy with applying for US grad schools, most of my female friends there were already in a serious relationship or already/about to get married. I was a bit worried but I told myself I still had time.I knew some female friends of mine also came to the US but they instead aimed to find American boyfriends to get married to (for GC). I told myself I don’t want to be dependent on anyone, that I wanted to get married for love, not for GC.I tried my best to get admission to the top 5 enginering schools in the US. It was the toughest thing I ever did. I was happy but then struggled a lot. I had no social life and only focused on study and job search. I graduated and luckily landed a job. I managed to get the company sponsored me a GC and finally got one. I was happy but then unfortunately got laid off. And still unemployed now due to the bad job market.Now while still struggling to find a new job with my limited savings, I also had some time to decompress and reflect on the life journey I had. I wasn’t really happy in the past 5 years. I know I need to change something. I don’t want to continue being like this. I need to do something to improve my life.Looking at some of my old female friends back in my hometown now got married and some had kids,... While me being here, lonely, struggling with dating and finding a good guy to get married, and at the same time, have to find a job and dealing with all the stress in life,... And those guys in my hometown that I rejected 5 years ago are all now happily married...And seeing some other girls that are now married to some rich American husbands, seems that they never had to worry about money and layoff.... I started to ask myself... what’s wrong with me.... did I make wrong choices...Did I choose the wrong path for trying to be independent and follow my dream? If I were okay with being the traditional wife at home, or focused on finding an American husband instead of studying, I would already got married and had kids at this point, that I never had to worry about money, GC and layoff,... while having a happy family to enjoy life with everyday.I know I shouldn’t compare myself with others. But it’s hard to not to, because I’m not happy with what I have now and really want to see what I can do to fix it...My friends told me that I’m pretty and they were surprised that I was struggling to find someone. They thought it wouldn’t be that hard for me to find a good guy to get married to. But I was too focused on studying and career in the past few years; missed so many opportunities/rejected many guys because I was busy or picky,.... and now I’m getting older and harder to date. I regret for not trying to date more when I was younger. Most guys I dated recently weren’t looking for something long term, or not a good match... which makes me feel hopeless... I do have some standards and now I’m asking myself should I drop these standards and try to compromise...It hurts to realize that I wasted my youth and pretty for chasing this American dream...I’m now so worried as I’m already in my early 30s. I don’t have much time left to build a happy family that I always dream of,... to find a good husband and to have kids... while my biological clock is ticking... I think I should try to prioritize dating, but how can I focus on dating if I still have to find a job in this market...While the American dream is still undone with the layoff, my dream of building a happy family also seems so far away....What should I do now with my life? I’m stressed, depressed and confused... What I did wrong in my life and how can I fix it?(Serious responses only please!)",,6/2/2023,169,6474,70,Family Issue,Stress

I know my parents and spouse don’t ever mean anything ill for each other.I do get why my spouse feels the irritation tho - they don’t like unsolicited advice, which I’ve tried telling my mom to stop. Sometimes it’s second nature for her that she doesn’t even realize it qualifies at unsolicited advice.It really affects me when my relation with my spouse gets affected. This has been a trend espc since my parents visit and stay with us for several months at a time. I do acknowledge what my spouse feels, and have tried telling passively telling my mom to stop doing certain things (like illogical comments or unnecessary advice), but I also don’t want to hurt my parents in the process of telling them over and over.

During our initial conversations about India vs US living long-term, we only talked about how wife's opinion should also be considered when moving back n I was all for it (go women empowerment). Then, we got married in India, she came over, we spent good time together, she got her education from the US, n now both of us work in the US, making good money. Our parents are in their 70s, both sides get along well with one another, so they travel to the US together every other year n we visit them in India every year. We both have been trying to also have our first child but it's been tough with stress from layoffs n once a week fight about small things, but mostly may have to go for IVF.Background about our marriage n personality: Being Mama's boy, our marriage has certainly not been the strongest, but we do love one another very much and spend a lot of time together. We eat together, WFH together, do things together without anyone else (given both of us are introverts), and occasionally hang out with friends. We talk about finances together, help each other in our career. I am not feminist, but I am all for women empowerment and do strongly believe that everyone should write their own story of their live (ironically, I came to US just like I studied engineering only because my dad pushed me to).Current: after our most recent trip to India, like our previous trips, I started feeling very strongly about moving back to India. But this time, after seeing real people moving back to India (#returntoIndia movement) and primarily after realizing how much less time I have with my ageing parents (after watching n reading: https://youtu.be/XQ_sMzT16es and https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/moving-india-after-decade-usa-thought-process-ankur-khator), I realized I have to move back to India. I have been nagging my wife about this for past 10 years but this time it was at a different level. Up until now, we both were at a high level agreement that let's wait for our green card (for 5 more years) so that we have options and then take 2-4 years sabbatical to spend time with parents in India and then come back to US to raise our future children. But after this recent visit and understanding how difficult it is to really maintain a green card and live in India at same time, I become very clear about my desire to move back to India Permanently. Unfortunately, I brought this up to my wife during a small fight which ended up becoming very very big to the point that we discussed divorce.The fight: I woke up and was so much caught up in researching about moving back to India on my phone, that I forgot we have to get ready for work and ended up ignoring my wife. She naturally didn't know why I was ignoring her, so she got up and went to work. I brought her breakfast and because I have a habit to not able to keep anything within, I start telling her how I cannot live in US n want us to move back to India permanently. Naturally, she has a career, we are trying for a baby and in that irritated situation she just got really really upset and started crying. Then I started crying and explaining to her how our parents are getting old but she kept saying let's wait for green card, she kept saying how I have ruined her life and how my mom has influenced me n how she has built up resentment towards me n my mom because of our past fights and how she can't live with me most certainly not in India close to my parents. I kept telling her we will live separately from our parents in different cities and we can find good jobs in India in big metro cities (our parents live in smaller cities). Finally, she ended up saying she can't live with me n wants divorce while crying (2nd time this has happened).I do hope she doesn't mean divorce literally, but this fight has put a lot of stress on me. I can't work, I can't visit friends, I can't do anything. I feel guilty of taking away her US life from her, but I do very clearly know that I have to go back to India with or without her because I don't want to regret not being able to spend enough time with my parents while I have the chance.I hope this fight makes us, not breaks up, but only time will tell.#mentalhealth#burnout#depression",,5/20/2023,302,7201,35,Indians Issue,Stress

General Motors,onspectrum,Adult ASD diagnosis,"I believe I maybe on ASD but I want to get a formal diagnosis. How do I go about this?Here are some of my quirks that have led me to believe I maybe on ASD.1. I am very obsessed with symmetry, to the point if I scratched my left elbow, I'd wanna scratch my right elbow just because. If I'm cooking, I will try my absolute best to chop produce all the same size and get mad if it's not.2. I am very obsessed with patterns. The carpet in my work lobby has a weird pattern of 2 colors, I make it a point I am walking only on one of them. To this day I cannot step on joints on the sidewalk. I plan my steps to make sure I never have to step on one. If I am waking from A to B, I plan out my routes to see the most efficient or least intensive paths irrespective of what path I do eventually walk on.3. I lose attention but I get fixated on things very easily. I can be obsessed about say my yard but would not remember what I was talking about 5 mins ago.4. I interrupt others a lot. And it's not cos I am trying to be rude, in my mind I have a conversation and I just speak out of turn.5. I like to learn a lot about a lot of trivial and useless things in life.6. I struggle with delegating cos I feel the other person will not do justice to the job. This was the case even back in highschool when I would do the whole project on my own cos I didn't trust me friends to do it right.7. My clothes must be folded a certain way. I may live with some here or there but I've had fights with my spouse over their folding and/or laundry techniques (theirs is darks vs lights, mine is tops vs bottoms vs underwear cos I feel washing an underwear in the same load with my tshrt would somehow make my tshrt less clean)8. Spotting patterns or obvious patterns make me genuinely happy.9. I sometimes have facial twitches and I reproduce them so they're symmetrical on both sides of it only happened on one side.10. I start a dozen things but only complete about 5-10% of tasks11. Untidy house gets me so confused that I can't even begin to figure out where to start clean. I can do it all if someone tells me what to do next12. I struggle with understanding things that aren't spelled out obviously.13. As a kid, I would blurt out shit when I wasn't supposed to. I would not understand the premise of a social lie.14. Lullaby like music relaxes me. I listen to baby music on my way to work at times.15. I perform post mortem on all my financial ecisions be it buying a needle or an airplane or selling a stock or holding further. After I make any purchase, I agonize myself by making sure I got the best deal for days by checking the price again and again.#mentalhealth #autism",,7/7/2023,13,114,5,Bullying,Autism

I was really happy to hear his support and decided to invest more deeply into the relationship.A few weeks later, he insisted that if I do not agree to go back with him, he would break the relationship right then and there. I felt cornered and I agreed to it. In all honesty, I work in research and my career choices in India are pretty limited to non-existent. Also, I work in a female deficit field which can be even more challenging (irrespective of which country I’m in).I made him aware of this and mentioned I might have to be a stay at home wife if I move back to India and asked him for a plan about the move back like when to move back, where in India does he plan to settle and what is the reason for him to move back ( in retrospect, he mentioned availability of street food as a reason and I was a bit upset that I have to give up a career for street food).I heard an earful from my family for asking him for more clarity and letting him know about my job situation in India. I just turned 30 and am subjected to lot of criticism and pressure to “settle down”. I was told that I am very picky, not open to compromise and am too career-oriented. I worked really hard to earn a PhD and develop my research. Lately I’m scared to even tell anyone if I won or achieved anything. I do want a relationship and marriage but I feel nobody cares if I am happy or not.I am feeling abandoned and very cornered. I don’t know if I should even work or aim for a career path anymore. With the constant criticism, I feel extremely discouraged to even care about life in general.Edit 1: Thank you all for the tremendous support. I just wanted to clarify one part. Regarding the reasons for moving back, he never gave me a solid reason but mentioned street food and less discrimination as perks of being in India. I can see a lot of criticism against the guy but in his defence, he never answered my question clearly. Apologies for the lack of clarity in my communication earlier.Also, I must mention that I did ask him to not contact me till he has some clarity on the move back. I did see some comments on how women would be treated differently if we gave ultimatum. I agree with those comments to a certain degree. However, despite this knowledge, I intentionally gave him a do-or-die deal to “give him the taste of his own medicine “.Please help me.#depression #burnout #mentalhealth",,4/30/2023,369,13900,124,Indians Issue,Burnout

She is a good listener and encourages me whatever I do like “You did a great job” or “It’s tough for you, isn’t it?” or “I can imagine what are you dealing with”. Sometimes she asks questions like “How do you feel about…?” or “What made you to …?”.Unfortunately, she is not helping me anyway. She is not suggesting anything even though I ask her. She get confused when I ask suggestions from her like, “What should I do when…?” or “How to cope with…?”. She didn’t even find any issue what is causing my mental illness. I found some materials by myself by searching internet and helped me a lot. I talked with her about that, she was just appreciating me, nothing else.I can talk about this with my friends and they can appreciate me this way.

New,SamSepiol_,I cant even describe how I feel,"I am 23, working fully remote since January 2022.Before that I completed a Full Stack bootcamp (Hack Reactor) where I pretty much stayed in my house for 3 months, studying from 9am to around 8-10pm and barely went out to hang out with my friends or simply see sunlight.Before Hack Reactor I was laidoff from an Amazon warehouse to begin the year (told on january 1st 2021). Got a job I hated on a Wawa (fancy gas station) earning $11/h. Then I flew and worked on a construction project down in Texas, 7 days a week, from 6am to 6pm, earning like $1200 per week, I went with my at the time girlfriend, my best friend and his girlfriend. We all shared a room, my girlfriend cheated on me with the manager and had the balls to say even if we broke up she wanted to stay in touch with my mom (just to give you an idea of how sinic she was), after that I worked doing doordash and uber eats while I found a job back at home and then I started working as a Walmart associate ($14/h), earning barely enough to help my parents with my part of monthly payments (rent, food, etc). I pretty much studied and worked 50-60+ hours per week.Fast forward to december 2021 and I got my interview with a company from Chicago, they hired me as a Junior Front-end Engineer TC 75k. I loved my team and there was a lot of learning as part of my first professional year in the industry but after the honeymoon phase passed I started feeling everything.I live with my parents in a 3 bd apartment close to where they work. My room is also my office, and in my desk I also have a gaming pc. So pretty much I wake up, and work and play on the same room and due to the nature of my relationship of my current gf I stay like 80% of my time between these 4 walls. I go out of my room to eat and shower.I started working out back in may with one of my closest friends 4-5 times a week and I felt so good until I had a surgery on my chest to remove precancerous cells, after that I've pretty much stopped going to the gym.In February 2023 I got laid off but fortunately my previous CTO put me in contact with another company and in less than 2 weeks I had signed an offer.I feel empty inside, I don't enjoy work nor feel engaged, I don't read books anymore which I used to do, I don't listen to podcasts which I used to do, I don't go to the gym anymore, I've lost like 5 lbs but gained a ton of belly fat, I've wanted to start some personal projects but I can't even dedicate 30 mins to them consistently. I've discussed a lot with my current gf (we are on long distance with plans to move together in a couple of months), my dad stopped talking to me (won't go into details) and everyone in my house is extremely tense. I've thought of moving on my own but I earn way more than my parents so I decided to stay for another year and save enough for a house downpayment for my parents so that they dont have to move every 2 years because of rent (they work retail) we are immigrants, they are closing in to 60, are not as fluent in english and are not in shape, they walk like someone who is 80.I don't know what to do, I don't know how to feel, sometimes I'll go on night drives and end up parking and crying and screaming to try to drain a bit. I try to go out with my friends to put my mind on to something else but the minute am not with them I am miserable. I try to at least walk 30-45 mins and dedicate 30 mins to my project, eat healthier but can't stay consistent, my sleep schedule is trash...Btw, I've had therapy sessions with a psychologist since may-june 2022YOE: 1 and a couple of monthsTC: 105k",105000,4/4/2023,517,59000,473,Family Issue,Therapy

Went to social dances even though I don’t know how to dance. Learned moves and definitely wanna join serious classes 😬2. Mountain biking + adrenaline rush = dopamine . e-Biking around city is best form of transportation IMO. You can beat car traffic and no need to worry parking. Thanks for Amazon for commuter benefit. Only good positive park of working at Amazon.3. From past few months I’m constantly going to meetup groups events, brunches, free workshops , bars and brews and exchanged numbers, talking to people . People are nice, friendly and laid back chill. Although no of male > female but you gotta be the coolest person in the room. Listen more and speak only to spark the conversation 😉 Met some really nice woman. Hoping to see her again in next event 😀🤗4. I’m into music and singing all genre of rock so practising feels the emptiness by 50%. You need something connected to soul.5. Seattle is a cool place live music bars, clubs, karaokes. There are so many places for indoor rock climbing. So many new things to learn like martial arts, piano, agriculture, algorithmic trading.Not mentioning gym since more than 15% body fatThere is a hope which keeps us alive.

I calculated how much money I wasted in the last decade and half, especially with possible compounding and immediately felt a heavy heavy sense of loss, a heavy perpetual blanket that has not gone away in the 5 months since. Has anyone else gone through this? How have you worked through it? I know it’s my own fault and I can appreciate the concept of atoning, but I want to feel better.Edit: since so many of you dm’d me to ask, based off of various parameters (50% savings rate, aggressive growth portfolio, 401k match) my number was between 5-7M lost, enough to fire in a mcol area or at the very least augment for a comfortable living where I am now.Thanks all for the kind words and food for thought.

I live in Austin, TX.Some days I don't even leave my apartment, which I don't necessarily hate. But I absolutely hate my apartment complex though because people are constantly slamming doors all day and let their dogs bark nonstop on their patios. People smoke out in the public areas even though this is a designated non-smoking facility. I've reported 6 people so far with videos. And my asshole neighbor was throwing dirty baby diapers in my garbage can. It's all driving me nuts and to the point to where I will pay the damn $4k fee to break my lease and leave, I just need to find somewhere else to live.None of my friends live in this city anymore. I don't interact with anyone in this city. My family lives in Houston, my coworkers are on the west coast and the rest of my friends are spread out in different states. Sometimes I feel really lonely and take a trip to visit my family or a friend, which always makes me feel better. It makes me wonder if I'd be better off moving to a new city where I can do things with people more often...but I wonder if I can just do that here if I put in more effort?I've tried making friends here but there is a loss of interest in both sides at some point. We hang out for a few times and then we just quit texting each other or the other person starts to flake. Maybe I'm too boring. I don't really go out and do things, afterall.But at the very least I want to get out of this fucking apartment.

Google,wfqweg,Feeling lost dealing with unknown and uncertainty,"I was quite fortunate to be able to join Google as a new grad in an SRE team, but even after being here for a while, still feel constantly lost with this weird sense of pressure or perhaps more of a sense of insecurity.I had a few internships before joining Google (not as an SRE, nor were they big techs), but I was always able to quickly get ""comfortable"" after a few weeks, learning the code base, the tools, the workflows etc. I actually KNOW what I need to do to complete my projects and have a sense of control over my work.Whereas at Google, there is always so much I don't know, every project so far has been a new challenge with lots of things I don't know or understand. While I've learned a lot, it has also been quite tiring and kinda stressful constantly feeling like things are out of control. It always gets better once I've done some research, and gotten to know the domain better, but the feeling of uncertainty sticks around more or less.Does anyone else experience this? Or am I really not learning fast enough? And I kinda wonder if this is common trait among larger orgs.1 YOE170K",,7/1/2023,12,703,2,Job Issues,Stress

Apple,IlzY68,Confusion regarding in-laws,"we are Indian couple living in the US. Ours is a love marriage, my husband’s parents were completely against our wedding, and gave in after 4 years of convincing. I had to pay dowry and was not welcomed warmly into their house. They troubled my parents and I a lot during the wedding. My husband offered to give me money for the dowry but I rejected as it might cause problems if his parents find out about it in the future.I can’t tolerate their double standards and I am getting extremely upset thinking all the time about them. They visited us and stayed with us in the US for 6 months and troubled me a lot. They are extremely patriarchal and expects all the household work to be done by me (my mother in law helped me in the cooking but she kind of dominates me and i had to follow all her instructions while cooking). My father in law has always have complaints on me that i am not following traditions, not wearing traditional attire, not cooking properly, not making snacks, not spending time with them etc etc.One day there was a big fight, my in-laws shouted on both my husband and used even bad language on my husband when he defended me. At that time as a couple we were going through a very hard time in our lives. we were undergoing IVF treatment and I was taking 3 to 4 injections a day, going to office, doing all the household work. we didn’t tell them that we are doing IVF but that can’t justify what they did to us. From that day that incident got replayed in my mind almost every day and I had a traumatic effect on me. my house didn’t feel like mine until they left. The thing i regret the most is that I said sorry without my mistake on the day they had a fight with us.The thing that hurts me the most is that, they have a daughter, who lives in the US. She fought with her in-laws and she cut all her ties with their in-laws and got her husband separated from them. My inlaws are fine with her being modern, not following traditions, not keeping her gold with her in-laws. My in-laws even had a fight with my sister in-laws husband that he should not spend money on his parents.All the rules don’t apply to me. what ever their son and daughter does is right but they keep pointing fingers at others all the time. Their daughter can keep her gold at their house but their daughter in law should not do that. Their son should spend money on them like buying house, car, jewelry for them but their son in-laws should not do that to their parents. Their daughter won’t talk to her in-laws and can cut ties with her in-laws but I have to talk to them every day on phone for one hour and detail them on every single thing that happens in our lives. Their daughter can wear anything she wants but I should dress according to their wish. They enjoy all the money and comforts US gives them but we shouldn’t live in US but they want their daughter to be in the US because they don’t want her to be close to her in-laws. These double standards are something that I can’t tolerate.I do understand that they are important to my husband and i don’t want to behave like my husband’s sister in regard to my husband’s parents but the thought of them coming and staying with us is giving me sleepless nights. I am currently pregnant and they are planning to visit us. I am dead scared of this.When I ask my husband about this, he will be like he doesn’t care what his sister does to her in-laws but he wants to be a dutiful son. But what he fails to understand is that I have the right to live my life on my terms, no one has any right to control me, not even my parents.I am not able to process this situation, should i be compromised and act according to my in-laws orders to to prove my husband that I am a good person or to take my life into my control",,6/3/2023,66,2357,15,Indians Issue,Trauma

Splunk,am I ok,I had rest. But still burned out?,"I hit burnout in summer 2022. I started taking nootropics to blast through it and I performed really well for a couple months, until Sept.I did ok in Sept and then I had a bad month of Oct. I voiced my burnout to my VP and HR rep. They gave me one week off at the end of Oct and I came back to a pip.I took the severance and went on my way, planning to relax with family to wrap up the year. I didn’t have another job for months later (Q2 of 2023). I was not grinding in the job market, so I certainly wasn’t burned out or working hard during that time.Once I started at a new company, I don’t feel burned out like I did before, but I feel quickly defeated when I have to really concentrate and overcome adversity.

Amazon,d73g4e2,"The Balance of Work, Life, and What Truly Matters","Hello, Blind family. Got a story to share with you today that's got me down to my core. Now, to protect my friend's privacy, I won't be disclosing the name of his company, his location, or any such identifying details.So, this mate of mine, we've known each other since our undergrad years, that's a good 15 years or more. Despite working in different companies and living in different cities, our bond stayed strong. This guy was a real firecracker, had ambition in spades and seemed to always land on his feet. He advanced in his career, found a girlfriend early on, even managed to double his salary in just two and a half years - always a step or two ahead of me.He had it all - a loving wife, two houses to his name, a stable job, and his beautiful 2-year-old daughter. His little girl, she has these bright eyes full of curiosity and a laugh that could brighten up the gloomiest of days. She was his everything, his shining beacon of joy amidst the daily grind.But then he started to realize that his job was gobbling up most of his time, time he wanted to spend with his daughter, see her grow, hear that precious laugh. So, he decided to cut back on his hours. But then the dreaded layoff season came around, and my friend was sweating bullets about losing his job. He decided to plunge back into work full-time, leaving less and less room for his family.In between all the work stress, he started obsessing over buying a swanky new car, a plush ride that cost 120 grand. His hefty 550k a year salary made it a feasible dream, but he was determined to buy it outright, no loans attached. The thrill of buying this car seemed to put a spring in his step, give him a shiny new goal to look forward to.But soon after, he started showing signs of detachment. He began questioning if all the hard work was worth the strain it was putting on his health and personal life. He'd put on a brave face, acting as if he was passionate about his job, when in reality he felt like he was trapped in a never-ending rat race.Then, one fateful day, my friend had a heart attack while driving to work. He managed to call 911, but tragically, he didn't survive.This whole ordeal has made me realize how fragile our hold on life truly is. In the mad rush for success, for the next big salary jump, or the next luxury possession, we often forget to cherish the simple pleasures life offers. I ended up taking some time off work last month, had a talk with my boss about needing a break for mental health reasons, and was met with understanding and support.So here's my message to all of you out there: don't let your pursuit of financial success harm your mental and physical well-being. Find joy in what you have, and express gratitude for your current blessings.Whenever I think about my friend's little girl, her bright eyes now filled with confusion, it tears me up. Sure, his family is financially secure, they have properties and cash reserves to last them for years, but what's the use of all the wealth if it can't bring back their beloved father and husband? Money can buy a lot of things, but it can't buy time with your loved ones.Thank you for your time, and sorry for the lengthy post. Take care, and remember to maintain a healthy work-life balance. It's more important than you might think.#burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,6/13/2023,7,418,30,Family Issue,Stress

McKinsey,mcknz,A dose of positivity & support for a change...,"Would you believe me if I told you that a Blind post helped get me on track to landing the job of my dreams 2 weeks ago?I think we are all aware that (unfortunately) a lot of the posts / comments on here can be a bit toxic. A lot of trolling. Tons of shitposting. Endless TC d**k measuring contests.I do think, however, that the Mental Health channel is a bit different. A bit more real, vulnerable, and… human. So this is probably the best place to share.Background: Lots of ups and downs in my career. SWE at a FAANG then head of eng at a startup (horrible mistake). Went to quantum black (mckinsey) for a bit then back to big tech.6 months ago, I got PIPd.It completely caught me off-guard. Totally got snaked, but that's beside the point.Week after week and month after month on the job hunt I was losing more and more confidence and getting more and more anxious and depressed.Crawling through blind made matters worse, until I started finding some really inspiring posts in the mental health section. I started DMing some authors and commenters. It was really nice to speak to people going through similar positions.Building comradery with people going through similar struggles makes a huge difference, but that's just one part of it. It might sound silly, but I even found a few ""accountability buddies"" with other people on here in a similar boat. It really just made the whole process of being burnt out / depressed a lot less lonely.Most importantly, it gave me the motivation that was missing in order for me to be able to make real progress and change.Fast-forward to a couple of months ago, one of my blind buddies pointed me towards an in-person AI community in SF and introduced me to one of the members. Long story short, I started attending and met awesome people involved at some of the AI companies all over the headlines these days. One thing led to another and I got several interviews at places that had been ghosting me, months earlier.Now I can happily say I'm 2 weeks into my literal dream job. I love my role and my team is incredibly supportive. I don't really want to share the name of the company as it's a small team and I'd rather stay anonymous. It's still early, but there's a marked difference versus all of my other experiences. And the comp is literally 2x my last position.I was on the fence about sharing this because honestly I am not saying this to ""brag."" I really don't give a shit what complete strangers on the internet think of me.I'm sharing this because 6 months ago I was in a VERY different and darker place, and I got out of it.If you're reading this and similarly in a slump -- whether you're job searching or burned out in your current role -- just know that:a) There's something better for you on the horizon, no matter how shitty/difficult things are nowb) You shouldn't try to change your situation all alone. You need to talk to others, find support, expose yourself to meeting new people, and don't be shy to ask for help. Even if that means baby steps like chatting with some good people on blind.Wishing everyone here all the best <3#mentalhealth #burnout #depression",,6/8/2023,11,246,26,Loneliness,Burnout

#ReadyForWork,yukmbvd,I don't regret having kids,"I saw the post linked below and I decided to write down about my experience having kids. All of my kids are under 6, so technically people say I'm living the harder part (not sure about that, but ok).TL;DR: having kids can be good. Or, it can be bad. Luck is a big factor- They love me, they love us. I haven't seen such pure minds loving you unconditionally - we are everything to them- They evolve quickly. One day they can't do certain things, the other day they can and will build from thereI will say having kids is not the only way of enjoying life - as I did enjoy my time single and recently married.But, I will also say I have a few things that made me reflect whether I was doing the right decision. As the other op said:- You nearly have zero free time. In my time as recently married, we were done with house chores Sat morning, which meant sat afternoon through sat evening we had free time to do whatever we wanted. Vacations, trips, so much easier- Money is a big factor. Just daycare is 2k/kid ... add supplies and essential items, it gets to $2,300/kid easily- I fight with my spouse more often than before. We fight for allocation of free timeBut the pros way outweigh the cons. I would absolutely do it again if I had the choice.Here are some things that I'd like to share with others- Only have kids if you are absolutely certain you're with the right person- Have a financial cushion. If you lose your job, don't let that strain your relationships- If you can, prioritize companies that value wlb. Ask specific questions to your interviewers- Be organized with your shit. Don't let the house get dirty, it WILL affect your mental health, especially with your time limited with kids- Be organized with your time. Similar to above, budget time for house chores, but also budget time for yourself. You need itI know I'll get trolled for days for writing this, but I'll write it anyway.

Delta Air Lines,sh610,Rant: Husband is not being responsible,"I love my husband and he does love me. He is most kindest person with a little bit of psychosis.He lost his father at young age and his mom pampered her only son. He is a good kid but lacks responsibility. We both met at college and got married. We are in our early thirties with no kids. I wanted to settle first and then have kids. He is very intelligent but just not interested in anything else except watching Netflix and talking about movies. He is romantic and happy go lucky and things about present, I am not romantic, plan and work accordingly and always worried about the future. He talks to me and supportive of any decision I make.I am the bread winner and finally going to close a house soon. But I am worried. He doesnt work and when I bring this up, he gets upset, try to do something for few days and looses interest later on. I have tried all the ways possible, talking, fighting and explained our situation. I really love this man, but I am tired. I want some one to take some responsibility of me for few days. I want to stay at home for few years while I raise my kids. Recently he is being very paranoid and always worried about what others are thinking about him. He went to therapist for 3 times and lost interest on it too. Or I don't know if I am over reacting. Some times we fight very badly that I want to leave him. But I just can't. He once told me he likes movies and want to go film industry but I was being practical and asked him to look for other professions. And he did. He used to listen to me before. I don't think he is listening to me now. He is too honest and don't have street smartness. But very intelligent and if he is interested he will be on it for hours if not years. Meanwhile I hid lot of things from my mom so that he wont loose respect for not providing for the family. I want to see him successful. Idk if I am ranting. I request if you have anything bad to say to me, please tone it down.. I don't think I can take anything more. I cried for few hours recently with out him knowing for no specific reason. I don't know if I have to see a therapist.#burnout #mentalhealthYOE: 6 yearsTC: 140k per annum.Edit: thanks all for your replies, I get to see different perspectives. he is a very decent husband. I cant blame him, he is supportive, he listens when I need, he has lot of patience. He cooks for me. And most of all, he protects me. He defended me many times when I couldn't. He is very silent. I'm his only genuine friend. We have more than 12 years of relationship and 4 years of it was long distance. Inside I know he wants to help and provide to me. But I don't know whats going on. But it's not working. He did try many things. He is very committed in the relationship and he has done his side of sacrifices to be with me and honest man who doesn't look at another women. Trust me that's the best deal. I want to help him achieve some thing but I don't know how can we over come this. I know from our past that if he commits on to something he does it. But he isnt commiting to anything. He lost confidence in himself.Edit 05/25/23Me and my husband discussed and he opened up to me pouring his thoughts and fears. I know is he has insecurities but I came to know the severity of those. He is struggling to improve. We have made a plan to get him a job. And I see him working hard for it now. All he needed was a push but in a supportive way, I feel bad that I didn't do it early. I can see him getting a job and working for it.Before this we started to have lot of fights, all those are reduced now. All this time I was worried that he didn't understand me or society but rather I didn't listen to him and help him the way he wanted. The support I used to give him is not what he wanted. We are good now and hope all these things turn out well.And I thank everyone who responded even though this is not the right forum.

That just gets to me at times given that they don't understand am grown up now.As far as suggestion about disconnecting them from my life - my situation isn't still super bad like many others out there (like they don't lie to me or depend on me financially or harass my wife) that I can disconnect them from my life.Takeaway - Given a lot of suggestions, I got to balance between what I care and what I shouldn't.- selective caring.

Intel,redeemed,Visiting family in India,"We are planning to visit India with our toddler after 3 years. While not too excited about this travel we feel we must introduce our son to our family and possibly do a health check.My relationship with both in-laws and parents has been miserable. We had no emotional support during and after our pregnancy and before that our yearly trips were a nightmare. Constant criticisms by in-laws to give a grandchild etc, verbal abuse and neglect by parents, kicked out of home over arguments e.t.c. My parents, in laws and relatives all seem to have a good rapport and specifically band together well to discuss our life or to do a smear campaign.My in-laws requested us to visit and mom cried that we are hurting in-laws. When we finally informed that we are visiting I was ghosted by my parents.Despite all this we have this guilt to completely cut off from aging parents.Question - do you think we can stay in a hotel to not be vulnerable and invite more trouble. This will mean more gossip and taunts but there will be some breathing space.I tried to not delve too much into details. TLDR - is there an alternative to staying with parents or in-laws during India visits. Planning mini trips or staying in a different city is pointless. We are also forced to be in India for at-least 3 weeks owing to H-1B visa stamping.#mentalhealth",,5/17/2023,69,2421,13,Indians Issue,Mental Health

ex-Amazon,mnfjepw,I am a people pleaser,"** This a self experience post. If anyone like me dealing with mental issues, it could be a cause too **After 25 years, I get to know a term called “People Pleaser”. Unfortunately, I found out I’m really is a people pleaser all of my entire life. Yes, I’m this kind of person who struggles to say “No” being scared of rejection and don’t know how to set boundaries for my own happiness.My family and friends were too good to me. Even though I was a people pleaser, they have never taken advantage of me or crossed the boundaries. But, after the relocation, I made new friends and a best friend here in Seattle. They were like, “I know you are best at it, could you..?” “I know you like doing it, could you…?” “Hey, can you do me help on…?” I used to say always “Yes” thinking of their happiness. I was taken advantage of, bullied and lost boundaries by them which made me left with no self-esteem and self-identity.But whenever I want some help, they don’t even bother to listen. One day, it got out of my hand, I just cut the friendships. They were like “You have changed a bit..” “You were not like this” “I don’t want to call you on my party” blah blah.I had started seeing a therapist which made me heal to a somewhat extend. But didn’t recover me back to normal.Then I have found the “People Pleaser” term. I know, it’s my fault at first place by letting them crossing boundaries. Even though I’m alone here in Seattle and miss talking with them, cutting with them made me more confident and happy.TC 220k",220000,6/16/2023,10,689,9,Family Issue,Others
Meta,yeehaw🤠🤠🤠,Helping my cousin with mental health issues,"Hi folks, this post is to seek help and understand how can I help my cousin recover, please read and suggest what to do.My cousin was a jolly and cheerful person as a kid, average in studies but still could survive through school. My aunt has a very competitive and jealous nature, and that lead her to push him harder at studies and extra curricular activities as we grew up, but he wasn’t very serious about things. As we grew, his carefree nature took a toll on his life. He almost passed high school and couldn’t get into a good school near our home. So he had to commute 2 hours one way every day for 4 years until he graduated his Bachelors in IT.Things didn’t go well with his unmanaged expectations, and he couldn’t land a job anywhere. Eventually he decided to move to a bigger city and do a VFX course and move into Hollywood. But, during his 1 and a half year certification, the pandemic hit and the job market for VFX somehow disappeared. He couldn’t land opportunities for 2-3 months, and he fell into depression.He didn’t eat well, didn't sleep at all for days, talked to people very rudely and was violent (he thrashed his own parents) and couldn’t hold another job that could help him stay afloat. My dad and his dad took him to 2-3 different psychiatrists for an evaluation and a multitude of treatments. Somehow he calmed down, but the anti depressants made him sleep a lot and put on a lot of weight. Now, he is still depressed but also overweight. Since the last 3 years, it hasn’t been easy for my family and his to cope up with the mental and financial burden this has created. I want my parents to come live with me, but they’re not ready to do that because of my cousin. What do I do from here? Is there a future for him as well as my parents and his, retiring and living a carefree life again?#burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,6/27/2023,8,152,1,Family Issue,Burnout

#ReadyForWork,Nozuck7,Working abroad vs. staying with parents in home country,"I left to work in the US on H1B visa and recently returned back home to be with parents who are in their 70s and 80s. I really struggled to live in the same house as them (for context i am single) -- my dad has dementia and my mom constantly insults me (uglier than siblings, not earning enough, went to lousy schools etc) and we can't always get along. Growing up, she'd physically fight with my dad and it had a negative impact on how I view marriage and the construct of a family.I do want to leave as this is extremely depressing and counter productive and am contemplating returning to the US for good. On the other hand, I do fear that one day they will pass and i won't be there in their last moments.I don't think my situation is specific to me as many people live far away from parents but how do you manage around the thought that parents could leave this world without you being there?Also am I being an idiot for ""abandoning"" them for work far away in the US? Is there another way to think through this situation?Have a good Friday everyone.#mentalhealth #visaworker #expat #movinghome #singles #dysfunctionalfamily",,6/9/2023,15,419,7,Family Issue,Mental Health

Apple,i_apple,Hypothyroidism and thyroid nodules- anyone?,"My wife has been suffering from thyroid problems since 2018. First it’s a case of hypothyroidism and then an indeterminate nodule that was 1.5 cm grown to 2.6 cm post first child birth. She has terrible mood swings, dry cough, sore throat that comes and goes frequently and she attributes all this to thyroid. We have consulted two endocrinologists and both suggested surgery to remove whole thyroid. We are very concerned with this route because of poor quality of life, lifelong medication and a potential risk to vocal cords. For past 4 months she made drastic diet changes and been taking a special diet based on some online research and the nodule size is now 2.3 cm.

Meta,OFoJ54,Thoughts on Weight Posts from the perspective of eating disorders,"I posted this in one of those posts where men are complaining about their partners weight. I want to make sure it’s available for anyone who’s thinking about these things.So some of the disjointed comments at the end are because I was replying.I am here for anyone going through these feelings if you want to chat privately.While this post does discuss eating disorders I tried to avoid obvious triggers and numbers as that is never helpful.I had an eating disorder since i was 19. I started taking diet pills and when they were banned, I just graduated to other behaviors. My weight would fluctuate and it was a constant obsession. My main thoughts were food intake. Weighing myself multiple times a day and panicking over a pound or two. I would go into deep depression. It didn’t help I was in a relationship where my boyfriend would make remarks about my weight, tell me I’d be perfect at lower weights etc. He broke up with me when I was at a higher weight so I went into overdrive and I went into a full on spiral where I wasn’t eating for days. I ended up getting hospitalized because my roommate noticed and let my parents know so I got sent to a program.After leaving I was under intense therapy for years and put on antidepressants that made me gain weight which caused anxiety and periods of depression but I pushed through. I got so much shit from men over my weight. But I eventually committed to giving up the eating disorder and trying to become more accepting that my health was more important than my appearance.When I was in treatment, I can’t tell you how many women were telling the same story. How their mother’s issues with weight, how they saw their fathers treat their mothers, and how these things shaped their relationship with food.Men if you are married and have daughters recognize that they are watching how you treat your wives when their weight changes. Eating disorders are awful because unlike drugs and alcohol we can’t cut our demons (food) out.You want to be a good supportive partner check in on your partners mental and physical health. Lots of things can contribute to weight gain. If they’re having a hard time due to work or other stresses they might find comfort in food.I know you’re male and the partner is likely female because when the roles are reversed the women start dragging their partners to the doctor, the weight loss journey becomes a group effort.In a room full of 30 young women, 22-25 of them could trace their disorders back to their parents.The boyfriend also thought he was being helpful by the way. I talked to him recently and he’s still pressuring me to go back to my peak eating disorder weight, but now he adds “in a healthy way” like that changes anything. I have never been that weight unless I starved myself and maybe I just prefer having thicker thighs and not having bald spots from my hair falling out.Also fuck BMI. I’m curvier so my peak eating disorder weight was not what most would think of as scary thin. I would spend weeks agonizing why I couldn’t force my body to go below that number.Also food intake. For years I had this irrational thought that if I trained my body to accept less food eventually it would accept what some diets call the “right amount” of food. Any diet that says anything other than learning to listen to your body fullness and hunger cues is not a diet you should be on.Any woman on blind struggling I would want them to know. These posts are not the general consensus of men. There are guys out there who will value you for more then the number on the scale.#mentalhealth",,6/21/2023,6,81,4,Family Issue,Stress

Google,👩🏻‍💻🧑‍💻🏰🏯☮️🕊️,Socially selfish in friend groups?,"As I’m getting older, I’m realizing that more and more of my friends and acquaintances are “socially selfish.” Or just “doing weird things in group settings.”For example, if it’s a group of 3 girls at dinner, one girl will turn and have a 1x1 convo with another girl without socially engaging the third girl. Then they’ll later have a 1x1 with the third girl (while sitting at the same exact table) without engaging the second girl. They’ll rotate in that fashion instead of speaking to the full group or the crowd of people. Sometimes they’ll fully turn their bodies to the person they’re speaking to, so there’s no way for the third person to contribute or even hear the convo to find a way to contribute. When they try to contribute, they might be ignored (I hope not on purpose, but maybe because they weren’t heard?)I’ve seen this happen in 5 different sets of different social group outings in the past 4 weeks. The “group conversation” just doesn’t happen anymore, and it’s like people are more concerned with building an individual relationships or having an individual conversation while in a group setting — and it’s really awkward for the others.I’ve noticed this more now that I’m older (29F). I didn’t see this happen as frequently when I was younger (22-26 yo) before COVID.I’ve seen people clique up at bachelorette parties and socially exclude other girls. Sometimes just flat out ignoring someone when they try to contribute to a conversation.It might be because there are different levels of friendship / familiarity / interest between the different group members?

Amazon,xjnd,Lower back and hip pain,"I started experiencing a dull backache three months after giving birth. Earlier this year, I had a particularly severe episode of back pain. Although that episode resolved, I continued to find it inconvenient to hold my baby in a carrier. During the first three months, when I used to wear the baby, I didn't have this issue. Additionally, I feel slight pain in my hip when I bend. Over the past seven days, my hip and lower back pain have become increasingly severe. It's gotten to the point where I feel extremely frustrated and unable to handle my temper. At times when I rest, I feel okay for a while, only to flare up again. I'm also frightened that I may have injured my back and that my life won't return to normal. Meanwhile, my husband is out with friends enjoying a beer, and here I am, in pain and fear. I just feel completely lost in all of this. All I want is to be my usual self, free from pain.I have an appointment PCP next week, but my husband won't be able to accompany me.

New,leb183!9,How do I find peace with my current situation?,"Married with a 2-month old baby. Dated 4 years before marrying the guy I really love. Dating period was rough due to LDR but we both are people who believe in commitment, mutual respect and love, and hence stuck with each other through thick and thin. We decided to get married with parent’s approval from both sides.FF to 6 months before the wedding, his parents received their Green Card (applied 15 years ago thru family) and started living with him. I moved into his apartment right after our wedding. We never discussed this prior to our wedding as his father initially told him they’ll figure out if they like it here in the USA and decide later if they want to keep the GC or give it up and move back.I’m a jovial person and I get along with everyone pretty fast so I was very nice to his parents. Everyone in his extended family loves me as well, expect for his mother. Our families come from different communities so that might be the reason. Anyway, she treated me real bad when I used to be alone but would behave nicely in front of everyone else. Told my husband a couple of times but he wouldn’t believe me. Meanwhile his father started manipulating him to LIVE AS A JOINT FAMILY because that’s how they lived with their parents as well.Two years into this marriage and I noticed his mothers behavior getting even worse with taunting right in front of my husband. He stood up for me a few times but in vain. He even asked them to live in a different house in the same city but they emotionally blackmailed him again and now he has been asking me to compromise and work on making this relationship better.During pregnancy, my MILs behavior got worse as she didn’t give a s**t about me, my health or the baby. I lost weight and delivered my baby prematurely. After I got home, MIL wanted me to do household work while she takes care of the baby. I finally stood up for myself, yelled at her and pointed out to his parents how exactly they wronged me and that I don’t like his mother. Husband stood up for me at that moment. But now, three weeks later, he’s been constantly asking me to compromise for “just 25-30 years” as long as they live and then we’ll be fine!I’ve started hating my husband as well and I get irritated at every sentence he speaks about them. I want to leave him because I cannot get rid of his parents as long as we are together. What are my options? How do I make peace with myself?FYI: I make more than him, we co-own the house we live in, he doesn’t own a car and still uses the one I purchased before we got married. I’m more than self-sufficient for my baby. AND YET, his mother thinks the house is hers and I should be at her mercy (typical Indian MIL fashion)#burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,3/29/2023,146,6271,97,Indians Issue,Burnout

Considering my savings, investments, and 401k, I suppose it’s not unreasonable to have something north of 5 mil by my retirement.3 I can focus on my career for now and maybe enjoy a bit more of life at the moment.Cons1 there’s always a risk if frozen sperm would live 20 years later :(2 my kid would have a full time father that is closer to their peers’ grandparent.

Uber,redgreenpi,ADHD is Ruining my Career,"TL DR; struggling with ADHD and have been working on it, but close to being fired. It’s a real problem and while my career has been okay, it has also ruined it in many waysI know a lot of people here don’t get or believe in ADHD, but just want to get off my chest how not being able to manage it properly has affected my career and my health.I’m happy with how I’ve grown my career for the past 5 years, but also have seen the same sort of problems since I was younger. Some days I’m able to be so productive and people are amazed and tell me I’m one of the best people they’ve worked with. Some days, I’ll forget everything and be paralyzed how to handle situations. It makes it easy to believe sometimes that it’s just all in my head and I I’m making things up, and sometimes others think that too. But it’s clear to how many jobs I’ve either been fired from or almost fired from that this is a recurring issue, and that “motivation” or “maturity” are just ways to create shame, that don’t help anyone in the end.I wish people would understand ADHD is not just when you forget where you put your keys once in a while, or missing an appointment. For me, it’s been a consistent inconsistency around things like sleeping through meetings, locking myself out of the house, struggling with merging PRs even though they’re pretty much ready, and more. People think I’m lazy or incompetent, and sometimes I feel that way too and tell me that I need to change, and I do, but it’s not about motivation, it’s about a disease which I have improved on managing with medication, and exercise, and therapy, but sometimes doesn’t feel like enough.I’m close to getting fired again and I’ve accepted that and it’s okay, since I’m lucky and not on visa. I have faith that I’ll keep struggling to grow ways to cope and it’ll get better still, but it hurts that few people seem to understand, and asking for accommodations has been a nightmare. I’m sorry to everyone involved, from my coworkers who depend on me to myself and my friends who have to support me as I’m sad and going through tough times.

I have friends and great friends but everyone is pretty much busy with their wife/gf/kids or work.Recently, I bumped on an instagram reel that showed multiple men and each one of them saying if you are a man, you don't really have someone to share stuff with and you'll have to deal with this alone.Parents - they usually over stress over thingsFriends - Too busy in 30sColleagues - Fear of judgementWife / GF - ???My questions is: Is this how life is going to be?

Rivian,vsHO83,"After living 6 years of quiet life in the bay area, started meeting two strangers every week for coffee break ☕️","This may sound strange. I think so too. Since February, I started meeting two new people every week to have a coffee break. I’ve met 12 people and have +30 more people on the waitlist. I started it to bring some fresh air to my quiet life and then turned out to be a self discovery and recovery journey. I call it “Loud Introvert’s Coffee Table”.[How it started]6 months ago, I wrote “No Friends in the Bay Area” and received +450 comments. https://www.teamblind.com/post/No-friends-in-the-bay-area-grvf4VRYI had a serious problem of feeling extreme emptiness but didn’t have a person to talk to. I was one of the rat racers but suddenly lost motivation to be in this game. I thought what was the whole point of exchanging my prime time, youth, and health with paychecks? I tried therapy but it didn’t work. I’m happily married and always have my partner near me but we are very different people.Last October, I quit my job. I decided to invest my full time to recover myself. As part of my recovery, I tried several social networks to find people to connect with. But none of them worked very well. Sometimes too professional, sometimes too crowded. The conversation often went very shallow. I thought what if I start something that I wish to have. In February, I started sharing my story anonymously and asking people if they wanted to join me for a coffee break. This time, I went to Reddit to reach out to a broader range of people including non-techs. Somehow, this strange idea started working. I’ve been talking to two new people every week. All the people I’ve met are incredibly diverse, yet they share a great common ground. They are people in the bay area who are trying to keep a better balance and find like-minded others.[Start building a community]As it continues, people start creating a small private community. We started getting along as a group and sometimes I help people get connected. People in this group like introspective thinking, enjoy exchanging honest thoughts, and value being heard by others. I’m imagining what could happen if I have 100 people in this community.If you think we would have a matching vibe, come join me.

I thought I was dehydrated but that wasn’t the issue and the illness slowly started to reveal itself until I realized something was wrong.I felt like I was having panic attacks but it was just the pain I was experiencing causing me to feel stressed. Once it developed and I went back to school, it got worse.People started to notice something was wrong with me because my joints make a breaking noise about 700 times a day. They always seem startled or flinch when it happens. They avoid me because it weirds them out. Some laugh too which sucks because I didn’t expect to get bullied in college. I eventually stopped going because the teachers and students would get uncomfortable when I entered the room. I’m very emotionally aware and them noticing my awareness made them more uncomfortable haha.I told my family since it was taking a toll on me, and they started acting like my college peers. Flinching, avoidant, and slight embarrassment which hurts me a lot.The thing is I can’t get treatment for another few weeks until I can afford health care again. There’s no full promise this illness will go away as it can be a lifelong illness.

There's no way that I will be able to get my performance back to meeting expectations, I've been a high performer since I joined the industry in 2015 and this is the first time I've ever had performance problems. So I'm starting to really think that the reason for my bad performance is due to my stress in my personal life, as that combined with high stress at work tipped me over the edge.My company has unlimited pto, so I'm going to use that and then move to disability insurance for stress. I looked at the wording of the benefits in the policy and it specifically says that if you have a change in your mental state that makes you unable to do a material part of your job you qualify, so I think it's a legit reason.But I feel guilty for taking leave, I feel like disability should be things like cancer or being maimed in a car accident. Not stress, I've always believed of I work hard I can push through tough times, but this time I don't feel like I can.

Meta,whoppe,How to find closure after learning the OG owner of my home shot himself in my garage.,"Hey everyone, have a creepy story and would like the internets opinion.Bought my house 2 years ago. It was in a bit of rough shape, so got a good discount and figured I could fix it up.The first neighbors that had lived in the neighborhood always seemed to be referencing some sort of ""invisible elephant in the room"" when I spoke to them, and always just assumed it was the fact the previous owners didn't take great care of the home.I don't believe in ghosts, and never had any creepy feelings in the house, even really late at night all alone. The garage door was the only thing that was finicky, but I knew there was a logical explanation for it.The garage door light attached to the lift motor would randomly turn off and on. Plus, the door itself would open on its own. Sometimes in the night while I was sleeping, but also in the middle of the day. After investigating it a bit, it turns out my neighbor's garage door across the street would open mine. The first time I found this out, I ran across the street to talk to them and test it to confirm, and ignorantly joked: ""I was starting to think my house was haunted"". They didn't laugh. I ended up powering the garage door with a wifi socket as a cheap fix because there was no way to program the garage door to not do this. Each time my neighbor would open my garage they'd run over to my house and say: ""Just letting you know I opened your garage again, so you're not wondering or freaked out"". It seemed awkward to me they did this because I hadn't known the full history.Anyway, I was out raking my lawn when another neighbor walked by with his daughter to play with mine. After they ran some ways away, he told me: ""Yeah I knew Bob, it's a shame he shot himself in your garage"". This information was so unexpected to me I didn't realize how much it would effect me. The neighbor didn't know I didn't know. The state I live in doesn't require this to be disclosed, and it wasn't the immediately previous owners, but the ones before them.After discussing it a bit I changed the subject casually, with this information still sinking in. As the day went on I slowly got more and more shocked by it. I couldn't sleep at all that night and decided to look it up to confirm. All of the previous interactions with my neighbors made much more sense. Sure enough, I was able to locate the obituary. The funeral service was held at the closest venue to my home, and the guy's name matched the records I had in my home. Oddly enough before I bought the house I did one of those: ""Has anyone died on the property"" searches and it came back negative. So FYI those are not worth it.Anyway, today I looked at my garage much closer. My truck is old and leaks oil. It's pooled up on the garage floor in a very particular way approximately 6ft away from an obvious drywall patch on the ceiling I hadn't ever paid too much attention to.I haven't told my wife, and I don't plan on it. Above all I don't want my kids to know. Here I am on night 2 unable to sleep. I'm merely being haunted by the idea and this realization. It seems either ghosts aren't real or this particular one has surely moved on, but the amount of annoyance with myself and regret for not figuring this out before I got the house is keeping me awake.Anyways, I feel like I need closure on this issue. I want to figure out more about this person and maybe even ask the neighbors. I'm not sure this will bring the closure I need or make it worse.I'm very much thinking about moving out, but with mortgage rates the way they are, it doesn't seem like the best move.Thoughts?#housing #insomnia #restlessness",,4/18/2023,77,3355,22,Loneliness,Others

Should I still go to the wedding?________________________Bride invited me to her bachelorette weekend and her wedding, but I’m not a bridesmaid. I rearranged my whole life and rebooked an expensive international trip to make it to the bachelorette, since I haven’t seen the bride since before Covid.I don’t know the bride extremely well. We met in late adulthood as 1x1 friends and don’t have a broader friend group that we’re a part of. All of her bridesmaids are from her high school, and they’re a part of a little hometown high school clique. I’m 1x1 friends with the bride from later adulthood, but we sort of lost touch after Covid since we moved to different cities. The Maid of Honor (MoH) seems to be the popular Regina and the bride seemed desperate for her approval. The other bridesmaids seem to be plastics, and I think the bride is a wannabe-plastic.At the bachelorette, both the bride and the bridesmaids basically refused to talk to me (it was so awkward) and completely ignored me. I was meeting all of bridesmaids for the first time. Whenever I’d try to contribute to the conversation, they’d shut me down or say something mean to imply that my conversation contribution was ridiculously stupid or irrelevant. I felt like I was in Mean Girls.Why did she invite me to the bachelorette in the first place? Ugh! I felt extremely unwanted there.After the bride saw that the other bridesmaids weren’t “welcoming” towards me, the bride started ignoring me too. I was confused the entire time because the bridesmaids all seemed superrrr nice in the beginning, but in retrospect I think they were just being polite and fake, but later talking being rude behind my back. The bride was fine and normal with me 1x1, but her Maid of Honor (“MoH”) was the Regina and the bride would actively ignore me or treat me badly in front of the bridesmaids, as if to stay in the good graces of the MoH. For example, I sat next to the bride for an entire group dinner and the bride ignored me the whole time, facing away from my side of the table physically to engage with MoH and the other girls. I was also rooming with the bride, but we barely spoke in our room because she would go to the MoH’s room to hang out with the bridesmaids. I’m 29 and had a breakup with a LT 2-year boyfriend, so I was also emotionally in a rough place.During the bachelorette, it was awkward because they were discussing the bridesmaids dresses and other stuff that I’m not a part of. But then all of the bridesmaids started begging me to be in this choreographed dance, because they’re nervous about doing the dance choreo poorly and want more people in the routine to mask up any mistakes.So I said okay. They sent me links to the YouTube video with the dance steps, and I decided to learn it. I asked the bride’s sister what to do during a formation change during one particular song and whether there would be a rehearsal to practice it. But it turns out they all changed their minds and want me to be in one song but not the other. It was the most awkward email thread. The bride’s sister emailed me and said that I should not do the song with the formation change and just do the other song (which other “just friends” will be joining in on).I’m not a completely socially inept person. I can tell when I’m not wanted, and I will happily bow out. I have no inherent FoMo or people-pleaser or insecurity-compensating instincts here. However, at no point was it *ever* made clear that one song was “just for the bridesmaids” and the other song was for “the rest of the friends.”Well, that’s perfectly fine and dandy, but why couldn’t you have just told me that in the first place (“hey! This is the choreo for the friends song, ignore the other one- it’s just for the bridesmaids”) instead of putting me in the super awkward position of being in this email thread? And now they’re acting like I’m not getting the message that I’m not a bridesmaid. Which is so stupid because you don’t need to be “delicate” / “vague” — just be explicit. I won’t be offended. Stop acting like I’m the desperate, awkward, try-hard — I’m just being put into situations where I’m clueless about what my role is and am trying to do my best.I don’t know if they were trying to be nice by inviting me to the bachelorette when I’m not a bridesmaid (it was happening in the city I already live in and the bride was flying into my city for it; there were some other non-bridesmaids there, but they were her cousins). Honestly, it just wound up to be super awkward and uncomfortable. I’m at my last straw with this stupid dance choreography awkward email exclusive dance thing.They’re acting like I’m a “wannabe bridesmaid” who is desperate / trying too hard. In reality, I’m just trying to be nice. Clearly it’s being misconstrued.Also, all of the “bachelorette games” consisted of tournament questions where you had to compete with the other girls on questions related to “how well you know the bride” and it was literally a point-card system. And clearly I don’t know the bride as well as her childhood friends, so I did poorly.Should I just not attend this wedding? I feel very unwanted by the bride. I hate for this to have destroyed my friendship with her, but it’s been so ridiculously bizarre / unfriendly / Mean Girls high schoolish. She should have just never invited me to this bachelorette and they shouldn’t have asked me to be in the bridesmaids dance (but then changed their minds).",,5/31/2023,15,450,1,Family Issue,Irrelevant
Google,Kvje65,lack of quality relationships/social circles,"I was struggling to make any kind of connections in California (I’m single). Most people there are taken and it was very non-diverse and the culture was off. I also struggled to make friends or anything in London because of so much in/out. Most of my London friends were long distance so I was starved socially (outside of work) for years (I am still connected to people from work and previous jobs).I moved to NY to reset my life socially but it’s not going well. I’ve lived here almost a year, put myself out there and have made 2 good friends (3 if you count the one I go to parties with) both via Reddit but finally in person friends.I get a lot of matches on tinder (and grindr) but I’ve not had actual dates this year.I have been to therapy and even have a physcotherapist who is fascinated by my struggles and speaks to me for free and reads the messages exchanged and says the guys I speak to are simply crazy. I continue to live my life but it’s becoming extremely lonely (outside of work which I love) because I basically spend weekends mostly alone (with hobbies I do alone) and even holidays I just plan and go to alone (despite asking others).The issue I find is the men here (I am gay):A) are taken ie married, open, visiting etc so we can’t really take anything further thereB) if single they are open to having sex with me but that’s it. I’m never included in anything else or seen as someone to date and everyone is clueless why.C) there is no attraction (mostly me to them) beyond a platonic friendship so it doesn’t progress (I have REALLY tried and my ‘criteria’ is quite wide).I am tall, handsome looking (so I’m told), fit body, earn well, Ivy league education etc so while this doesn’t guarantee me a partner I am confused why my metrics are so bad in this area of my life and struggling to get integrated even socially. Every other guy I sleep with literally now asks me ‘why are you not taken’ and it’s becoming very frustrating. The only ‘down’ is I am a POC so perhaps there is sexual racism but then they wouldn’t have sex with me in the first place? I am British born so more ‘white’ culturally anyway.I made a Instagram recently and see others constantly at parties, with friends etc and I feel very left out (and I know I shouldn’t compare) because I’m struggling to even find someone for a morning coffee and chat which seems crazy given we are in NY.Note: I am also the only team member in NY but I make a lot of effort to network and go to TGIF and speak to people. I am social. Therefore I don’t feel lonely at work. I’m just confused why this is so difficult outside of work.",,5/14/2023,31,932,5,Therapist Issue,Therapy

Microsoft,mEXI48,Is this behavior normal,"Exactly one month back i got impacted and I lost my job. Since then I have been hustling to find a perfect role in HR. Coming from a FAANG organization it’s taking time for me to accept the fact that I would be dealing with pay cut. Job search isn’t going to be that easy. In between of all this chaos all I kept asking from last 30 days to my husband is to give me space. I am still looking for my corner where I can just heal. Reset and start fresh. But he kept ignoring it. He has his job and doesn’t find it important to listen what I want to say. His definition of being a supporting husband is to send every morning 30 links of different job roles. Ohh yes He did take me against my will to an out of state family wedding to claim that it’s for my environmental change, and at this moment while I am typing his family members are here to be precious since last 7 days and they are still not ready to leave my home. To be frank I don’t hate them but they took over my space entirely I have to eat what they want, can’t listen music. Can’t lye down on my own couch. Infact I need to keep my mouth shut at that extend even when there untrained dog keep torchering my puppy, I can’t do much. It acts as an entertainment for his family. All I wanted is space .. my space for which trust me I paid each and every penny from my pocket. I asked my husband to support me, to empty the house bcos I need space in return he asked me to book and Airbnb for myself. He is ready to bear that expense. His father is super old school the moment he knows about my layoff , he is going to blame me for it. Therefore I asked my husband to let it be between us but then now whenever I talk about space he uses it as a reason to blackmail me. At this moment I am extremely saturated. I tried so hard to talk to him, thinking he was my best friend. But intern he keeps saying I am disrespectful, I have anger issues and if I need space I should find on my own he can’t do much. After every days fight I have started feeling that our relationship is just toxic. I am out of love. We have reached that level that even if we would be alone on a dog walk, he would prefer to be on phone vs talking to me. If ever I get angry and discuss anything of this with him, he would say his family is here bcos of their circumstance, and I am over reacting and I just keep fighting and I have angry issues. Therefore here I am to take an advice is it might fault that I had a layoff ? Is it wrong to ask for space in your own home? Am I responsible for others circumstances? I feel lonely , stressed and depressed around him. Therefore I feel like I should quit this relationship. His leadership doesn’t make me feel safe. What should I do next? Should I leave the house? Quit this marriage ? Or just ignore and wait time to fix things like old saying? #burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,6/9/2023,8,397,3,Family Issue,Stress

Amazon,yyrq0,Stressed about taking the vacation.,"I haven't visited home (India) in 7 years, and to be honest I didn't want to. I have a toxic extended family that bullies. Almost like high school where there is a gang of 'cool' people and everyone wants to be a member of that gang, they have a set of followers and all they do is spread rumors and make fun of others. They don’t invite others to their party but they always get the invitation because they are the ‘important’ people. They all have spoiled children with zero accomplishments. How did they become like this- The short answer is that my grand-mom was raised by a narcissistic stepmother. She never gave attention to all her children equally and they had to earn it one way or the other. As a result the siblings are now extremely successful shallow individuals who value money, looks and societal status only. So shallow that they wouldn’t even shy away from passing shameful comments for a new born!Since I haven't seen my immediate family for so long, they want me to come visit them, but that is stressing me out. In the event I only visit my own family and do not visit the others, I will be shamed and my family will be cut off due to my ‘rude' attitude. If I visit them, they will definitely bully me for being single, not finding a partner, and not coming home more often. I will also become a target for spreading rumors and hate.I don’t want my family to suffer because of my choices but this vacation is stressing me out to the core.

Square,aloSk2hs,Competition shuts me down,"I'm in my early 30s. I have a problem that hinders my career a lot. Even though I have good work ethics and will never ever play politics, secretly I see everything as competition. Someone had a good idea, someone delivered a project exceptionally well, someone made a comment and got praise - all these situations make me feel like a failure, as if it implies I'm not good enough because I didn't do it. And it makes me shut down and not take opportunities to show I'm also good at something because there's already someone who's enough, and I can never live up to it.I had that problem for a while, but it was fine while I was at a junior or regular IC level. I could always tell myself that I'm just growing and learning, and at some point I will be just as good as others. This point, as you can guess, never came. My tenure and role expects me to be more senior now, but I see much smarter, well-spoken and overall likeable people around, so I just want to crawl in some space and never come out. It is almost a form of self-sabotage. Worst thing, I was always lucky to land in a team where I could be better than most at least in one sort of skill: either domain area, or historical knowledge, or being a single lead on a project, or being a empathetic and understanding colleague, or being a patient mentor. Now I'm at a place where there are plenty of people who can do all of that and more, and I feel like I'm not needed at all. This makes me so upset, and I don't even have strength to pull myself out of that hole.I realize this is really unhealthy, I tried therapy, exercise, a bunch of things, but in the end there is always something that brings this feeling back.

Insurance Company,FFANGso,Why do so many people on blind talk like Andrew Tate or just say the most “edgy” thing they can think of,"Why do so many people on Blind (at reputable companies) act mean and hurtful just because they are anonymous. Seems like most posts get at LEAST 1-2 comments that are just intended to be snide or hurtful. I know it’s anonymous here, but some of the people on blind would love nothing more than to make a clever and mean comment to a person who is going through some awful situation. And usually aimed women and non-alphas.It’s also easy to spot, based on the comments, the people who say hurtful, racist, ableist, snide comments are likely doing it to feel good about themselves for a small moment.while simultaneously using slurs as a sort way of enacting punishment on the world for not giving you what you think you deserve.Be better. it’s totally possible that blind could be an anonymous group of supportive people in the same industry. Instead, people here often act a fool because it gives them a hit of dopamine by being mean to others.I hope #blind begins to root out incels, trolls and harassers.

Despite battling multiple mental health issues, this infact was my first true panic attack.My head was at 100mph, body was cold and hot at the same time, I could not take deep breaths because I felt 100lb weight on my chest, wanted to throw up, felt stuck. I tried to everything in my power to resolve this but I couldn't. I put a timer on blind and experienced some relief.I finally slept off using the drowsy effects of another medication I take..Today morning I woke up feeling the same. I have bipolar disorder and went into my second real psyotic break around 10.42 this morning. It lasted for a very short while and had to be put on an emergency antipsychotic dose..I have clarity now and I realized how much this app entertains and affects us at the same time. As I'm writing this post, I don't think I'll follow my own advice and get off this app. But instead as we head towards a very rough season for tech workers, I hope we can we kind to one another.

Let us really take a step back and help those who are sinking.For those prone to or already battling mental health issues , invest in atleast a temporary meditation schedule. For those of us battling things alone, take a walk.. especially those in Seattle. It'll be double whammy with SAD kicking in along with the rough times. A walk does wonders.

Sony,I34baS,Do you still remember that one engineer who stood up for you?,"Just some random Friday's night reminiscing.I graduated a couple years ago and was working as a junior for a 20 people startup company. This one day the CTO started a thread on slack in the ""all"" channel and falsely accused me of causing a bug on the dev environment and asked me ""please explain this error"", then our only senior engineer jumped in asap and said the bug was caused by a commit pushed by {anotherDevName}. CTO did not apologize, that's fine - but the senior dude became my role model ever since.Fast forward today, I just got a promotion and I am finally a senior dev. But if I do become a manager one day, I will make sure to treat my reports right and with great respect, just like how I was treated right and with respect by that senior engineer.I wish the best to him.Edit: For those that are curious, it was 5 years ago.Edit 2: I don't think throwing someone else under the bus is great idea either, even if that person caused the bug. To elaborate a bit more, the moment the CTO made that thread, I immediately went to GitHub and screenshot the git blame because I had nothing else to depend on, also if someone starts the blame publicly, you make sure to protect yourself if you have the evidence. But right before I post the screenshot, the senior left the comment.What made the senior became a role model to me was his action(albeit controversial) to protect the one who shouldn't be blamed. The actual comment was something like ""that was from {anotherDevName}'s latest push"".Anyways, this to me was one of the most valuable memories and been helping me to grow in different aspects of life. And yea, you have no idea what this junior will be capable of after a few years, and you will never know when you will meet this person again. Treat this person well and you will have a great connection, treat this person badly and you will burn this bridge that you will never know when you will need it.Edit 3: I just checked the CTO's LinkedIn and seemed like he was laid off recently and open to work. I would have gladly help this guy out if he wasn't being rude 5 years ago.Edit 4: For edit 3 maybe it makes me look petty, but I always help people who treated me with respect and refuse helping those who treated me disrespectfully. I wish I am more forgiving.tc 270",,10/8/2022,294,44200,1612,Family Issue,Others

Wish,omrcBz,"Unemployed, unhappy marriage, no passion, no direction in life","#depression #mentalhealth #burnoutEdit: Thanks to everyone commenting. A lot of food for thought.TL:DR is basically the title. 30 year old male. Customer support/business operations.Unemployed:Long story short, I unnecessarily put a target on my back by giving my manager a deservedly harsh performance review. I know/should have known better, but I let the situation get the better of me. The senior manager held that review against me and I was given a choice of PIP or severance. Lesson learned. I talked to a few people, thought it through, and took the severance.Everything got turned off 2/3 and I was on payroll until 4/3. It's been tough sledding in the job market.Unhappy marriage:Wife is very verbally, viciously abusive. Examples include- ""You don't deserve my love.""- ""You're not a real man.""- I shared an anecdote with her a long time ago about how when I was growing up, an older cousin had basically told me that I would never amount to anything. A short time after taking the severance, we had a fight and she threw that anecdote back in my face. She said that on one hand, when I told her that, of course she was offended and on my side, and then on the other hand, she wondered what that cousin had seen to say that, the implication being basically that she agrees that I don't amount to anything.We don't hold hands anymore. Not much physical affection. There's an immigration shadow as we've been working on a change of status for her. I'm honestly not sure what I'm fighting for. It probably boils down to sunk cost fallacy (8 years together) and I can recognize that. I guess I might say I'm stuck in the inertia.No passion:I don't feel anything. There's a big hole inside that I don't know how to fill up.The most recent interview loop I did, I got as far as the panel (round 3 of 4). When I got the rejection email, I didn't feel anything.I bought a nice jacket a few days ago for $400 that I had been waiting for to come back in stock. It was just a matter of inputting my card information. I didn't feel anything.I don't think I care about anything. I don't believe in anything. I don't have anything to fight for.It's a ""feeling"" problem. It's a belief problem. It's a passion problem.No direction in life:I don't know where I'm going. I'm just kind of drifting.I look at peers and I can see a clear career path and trajectory that they've been on. I look at friends and they're all settling down and having kids and buying homes.I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's just a grind to keep going. But I don't know why I keep going or where I'm going or how I'm ever going to get there.",,5/1/2023,27,1597,14,Toxic Manager,Burnout

Get tested timely for any deficiencies - eg. Bloodwork for vitamins (B and D), thyroid, etc.• Learn to take breaks - burnout is real.• Drink enough water daily - dehydration causes, subtle to severe, a lot of issues like brain fog, salt water imbalance, etc.• Learn to let go of negative emotions that are causing a lot of stress. Practice forgive and forget.• Write down feelings to articulate better and find root causes when necessary.• Be social. Take time to talk and connect with family and friends. Humans are social animals and need human connections to stay sane.• Go out in the sun - you’ll instantly feel a mood boost if you go out after a looong time.• Keep your surroundings clean - messy surroundings == messy brain.• Instead of comparing, count your blessings and express gratitude.• Learn to be a giver, not always a taker - try volunteering.• Exercise and stretch - it can be any sorts of movements as long as your blood circulates better.• Monitor the online/offline content you’re consuming.

Toyota,7pgYzG,Inequality in marriage,"Been married for over 15 years now. Both wife and I are from India, living in the states for ~10 years, no kids, mostly focused on work life. While marriages are all about compromises, I have recently realized that I have drifted away from my family in India while my wife has kept a tight connection with hers.Whenever I talk to my parents on phone (once a week), she gets uneasy, starts showing signs of anger and disapproval, on the other hand she talks with hers' every night after work. I used to do the same but moved to a ""once a week model"" to avoid fights.Her parents have visited the US twice since our marriage, while mine have not visited even once. Originally I gathered up some courage and planned on having them visit in 2020 but covid happened, finally this year I am planning again so my parents get to experience how their son lived for the past decade. But my wife now wants to visit India this year and she says we should both go so that we can both meet our parents. I asked when would be a good time for my parents to visit, she said maybe next year but then she insisted we invite her parents right after mine leave to keep things ""equal"".I have to always be extra careful when talking about past memories from India which involve anything about my family, she often gets offended and starts a silent war when I praise my parents by mistake. The root cause of all this is a fight that happened between my wife and parents right after marriage. Things got sorted out later, at least I thought so. Her parents and I too had a falling out but we have been cordial since, they even visited and lived with us twice since then.Don't know what I expect to get out of this post, just wanted to vent I guess. But I do feel like a failure, Indian parents pour their heart and soul into raising kids and here I am choosing peace above them.Edit: During the first 5 years of my marriage we have fought so many times. Wife likes to bring up small temperamental issues regarding my parents and since they are old they have some old/conventional thinking which she easily gets offended on. It's not like I have never tried standing up for myself, it just ends in a long tiring fight which exhausts all my senses.Edit2: I do love my wife, and she loves and cares for me a lot. It's just this one thing, too many fights on petty issues that don't even matter to our lives. Too much bringing the past into conversations and starting a fight where there is no real point.

Rivian,vsHO83,Coffee with two strangers every week since Feb ☕️ Walking away from depression.,"If you feel your life goes too quiet, or if need someone to talk to, I hope this helps.Some people may recognize me. I've met two strangers every week for a coffee break in SF Bay Area between February and April. It was my personal social networking project on Blind, Reddit, and Medium to deal with my long-time feeling of isolation. I understand that this may sound unusual, but taking a whimsical approach to social networking has been so effective for me to deal with my numb and quiet life in the bay area.Linkedin, too professionalMeetup, too crowdedBumble BFF, too vagueAnd Blind, too distancedAlthough I was always part of the crowds, I wasn’t able to get over the strong feeling of isolation. Loneliness brought depression, depression invited anxiety. To bring a radical change, I left corporate tech last October and focused on what I am truly interested in.Part of that, I started meeting two strangers every week for a coffee break. I wrote my thoughts and feelings anonymously and met my readers who responded back to me. Since I started, I got 70 people signed up, organized +25 in-person/virtual engagements, and met 18 of them in person in SF Bay Area. Throughout that time, I was able to put myself back together and get the energy to search for things that I truly enjoy.This is not about therapy or advice sharing. However, I found finding peer support works much better than therapy for me. It’s just a group of people who are looking for someone to talk to, but I've been able to have deep genuine conversations with people. If you’d like to give it a try, you are always welcome to join this small community. Previously, I focused on connecting with people for 1:1 with me. This time, I'll try to replicate the unique positive experience I've had for others who are struggling with the same feeling of isolation.I named the next round of coffee breaks “Around The Corner”. I sorted out about 50 people who are up for finding people for a coffee break. This list keeps growing. Most folks are from SF Bay Area. Recently, some people from different states and countries started reaching out to me. I added a list of people who opted in for matching. If you don’t see your location, don’t worry. Once you get into the community, I’ll create a new group for your location and see what I can do to get more peeps near you.Sneak peek into the people list: https://loudintrovert.medium.com/around-the-corner-people-72358ce70c2fHow to join: https://loudintrovert.medium.com/what-is-around-the-corner-798dde5c9effI will continue talking to two strangers every week going forward. Many people have asked why I am so enthusiastic about this work. My short answer is -- this is my first time ever creating something from scratch and seeing it works for good for myself and for people. As a previous rat racer who was always a small little cog of a giant machine, I can confidently say this experience stretched my horizon much wider.Wherever you are at today, hope you find some time to take good care of yourself and find your peace on the way.",,5/3/2023,9,580,25,Others,Anxiety

Microsoft,dontknow71,Could not figure out what’s next,"32 year old single Indian femaleDoing ok with profession, but not sure where I am going on personal stuff in particular about getting married. There are 5 different stories in my life with 5 guys.Guy 1- this guy was my high school crush. But never expressed my feelings till date. I knew this guy for almost 25 years of my life. He is just a crush. Even now I talk with this guy, he is a good friend. Though I used to like him, now he is very different. And I am sure that we are not compatible anymore.Guy 2- He is my friend from college. This time I know that it’s not a crush, definitely I have strong feelings for this guy. But I am scared to express my feelings. In the mean time he found a gf. So I don’t wanna disturb him.Guy 3- this was a bummer!! This guy is one of my childhood friend. He was interested in me. Despite of him being from a different religion(which is a big thing in India) I accepted to his proposal right away with out much thought. And there comes the twist in the tale, I gotto know that he was cheating on me with one of our common childhood friend. And was in relation with me just for the sake of money(I used to loan him a lot)I used to be so naive and innocent so could not take how he cheated and used me though I sincerely loved him. After this one I was fed up and depressed for some time.After 4 yearsGuy 4- that was time when all of my friends were getting married and settling down in life. I was not having a good job earning very less. Somehow I felt I was lagging behind in life and wanted to settle down, then proposed to this colleague of mine. I proposed around 10 AM he told he was not interested by 6 pm.P.s.: after 2 years when I landed in a good job, visa & with good TC he started talking to me. But I am not interested in himGuy 5- I am 30 when I met this guy, but I knew him back from college days. I was in a mind set to get married ASAP. We started to hang out a lot because of a common friend and I proposed to him. I asked him for reasons why he did not like me, after listening to his opinion on me I felt forget about being partner, he does not deserve to be as a friend. None of the people whom I thought as friends never misjudged me like him!My dad was my super hero until one day. To sum up he might be a good father, but in my view he is not a good husband to my mother. I am scared what if I end with a person like him as my partner?!I donno if it’s my dad or because of the people I liked I happen to have trust issues now.

Chubb,notwell55,5 yr Relationship Ended,"My 5 yr relationship with my gf has just ended. We are both 26. Ultimately she wanted to get married and I just do not feel like I can propose. I feel really young personally, and I think I just had some doubts about us.She was definitely more successful than I am, and I can see her reaching very high highs in her career. She’s leveled up a couple times, gotten nice raises, awards, people really like her at work.Part of my problem with engagement is she wanted to move to california, and I have always wanted to live in NYC. When we first dated we lived in Texas and I was really miserable without any friends/social life; we’ve since relocated back to where we are from. There-in lies my hesitation to uproot and move across the country away from family and friends. She feels I should be willing to go where she goes if its in pursuit of her career advancement and she can get a better job there.This is also my first ever relationship; maybe there is someone else who I would feel ready to move anywhere for?Now I feel immense regret and sadness that I’ve just blown this up and made us both extremely upset. We cried constantly and hugged for probably two days, and have been just talking through things. Finally we concluded we just can’t work this out.Has anyone gone through a painful breakup like this where they regretted their decisions? I just want to make everything okay again but that probably wouldn’t work. It’s really hard especially considering how graceful and loving the breakup process has been.

Only reason to be with her is our son who needs both parents and doesn’t want me to move out. FYI, we never fight in front of our son but obviously our relationship does get cold every other week and our son can totally sense I feel.I am wondering if I should ask her for a clear timeshare arrangement so that we can split our weekend equally with our son. Weekday evenings are kind of already split since she wanted this arrangement in the past. She did not want me around when she would call her family in India since sometimes if my son started playing with him during the call, she would consider it an interference. This has been told to me explicitly.Asking for a weekend split is difficult since sometimes it would mean one parent wouldn’t be able to see the kid for a long duration and would also imply that marriage is dead but it has been dead for most part for a few years now.More or less, this is divorce but living under the same roof 😂 As funny as it sounds, i really find it difficult when she tries to passively influence out son. For example this morning my son and I had planned an activity since Friday but she told him that she was going to a park to run and he could play there with me while she’s running . I told her that we will see her there after her run once we are done with other activity but she told me I was forcing our son to do this other activity. When I asked my son what he wanted to do, he clearly said he wanted to do both… and we ended up doing both.I seriously don’t know what to do.

Man Group,flying69,Depressed ones - Don’t give up,"Hi,I know dating market in Bay Area is tough. There are 100 google engineers just like you trying to date that cute Asian girl who only wants to date white guys. And if you’re a white simp male, it’s even worse because you’re losing the game and everyone still hates you. It’s bad and I empathize with your pain when you’re slamming your $500 mechanical keyboard and coding away your sorrows.Here are a few things which I would recommend you to ponder while you’re on your next hike.1. You’re just a chemical reaction in a large universe. You’re no worse or no better than any other reactions. You have nothing to prove to anybody. You have nothing to lose. And if you have food on your table you have nothing to worry about.2. Life’s a game of chance. People 10x smarter than you are stuck somewhere in a different part of world working 20 hours a day to make your iPhone and people 10x dumber than you are the CEOs of your company and banging your future wife/husband right now on their boat. And it’s all pure chance.3. You’re the dot product of all your life’s experiences and circumstances. You made all your decisions with imperfect information and none of them were right or wrong because u will never know the what-if reality.3a. The levels don’t matter. Only the change matters. Fun comes from growing and not staying still. You could be at 1 or a 100. But if you’re growing at 1% a day, you will be equally happy.3b. Don’t assume a constant rate of change everyday. There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. Linearity is a myth. Life is a more of a step function.4. If you shared a moment of happiness with a friend in last week, think about it. Or you left a funny commit message for a dev in future. Or when you cracked that joke and you created joy out of thin air. Or when you sang a song with your heart open at a concert.5. Think about that one time in your life when you felt proud of achieving something. Might be a tiny tomato on your house plant or that L3.5 at your bouldering gym that looked impossible. How you succeeded at something almost impossible.6. If your body is functional, and you have food on your table and you’re still not laid off, you have nothing to worry about.Remember this- you have been through a lot and you’re still here.- don’t ever let your circumstances define you.- your mother smiles every time she thinks about you.- a walk and good night’s sleep will fix most of the problemsIf you made it this far, you deserve to smoke a joint, king.

Meta,Skkkk84,The apprehension of losing everything,"The progress I have achieved in my life would be deemed remarkable by anyone. Considering where I started and where I am now, I have achieved everything without any financial support from my family or influential connections. Nothing was handed to me easily; I had to fight for every little thing I have.However, this reality creates a profound sense of fear within me—the fear of losing everything. The potential fall from my current position is vast, and this fear has a paralyzing effect on me. While some successful self-help gurus often advocate for not being afraid to fail, of course their advice doesn't hold up in practice.As I reflect on my situation, I realize that I lack any safety net or support system to rely on for a long time. If I were to fall ill and become unable to work, it would be the end for me. I bear the responsibility of supporting my family at home. My home country is at war.

Since the pandemic (even WITH a job) I’ve seriously struggling in and out with depression, anxiety, and feeling delirious.Ever since the pandemic I get this feeling that makes me want to scream into a void. Living alone doesn’t help. I plan to move out and get a roommate but I need a job first.I’ve been slowly interviewing but have motivation to not do much. I’m so fucking sick of Leetcode.

I’ve been going on walks, going outside, talking to friends, going to therapy, taking meds.I am just SO sick of this struggle with depression. I’m sick of feeling good and like I’m fine, and then if I stay isolated too long, I slip back into depression. I am exhausted. I’m not looking forward going back to work. Nothing about work excites or interests me that much anymore. Everything feels lifeless and grey. I HATE remote work, and yet I don’t want RTO because I don’t know where I want to live.I just feel fucking miserable.

Affirm,afirm tofu,Answer to the meaning of life,"What is the meaning of life?I was born into a basketball game, and never once did I think about the meaning of the game. It was just the same routine every day - shooting the ball towards the rim, chasing after it, passing it to teammates, and trying to score. It was an endless repetition, much like life itself - full of just reaching towards a goal one after another, endlessly, and full of competition. I didn't know any different, and it seemed natural to me.But then, one day, something changed. Suddenly, I started to wonder what the point was of shooting a rubber ball towards a metal ring, and why humans define their happiness with the position of the basketball. Us humans defining their happiness on arbitrary, meaningless goals. I started to slow down on the court, pondering this question, and stopped running so much.As I observed the endless field of basketball courts around me, I saw that many others were also wondering the same questions as me. It was fascinating to see that everyone had a different reaction to the question. Some returned to the game quickly, as their teammates were shouting. Some started praying. Some started meditating. Some became sad and depressed because they seemed unable to find the answer.Others became more aggressive in the game because they thought that maybe if they shot the ball into the rim more or scored above a certain number, they would find the answer. As they reached the number or the goals they set, they were happy for a while but soon become empty again because the question is still unanswered. And some of them just decided to set another goal. I just sat there and observed everything, realizing that my game was still on, but I simply didn't care.Then, after a few years of sitting on the court watching other players play, something profound occurred to me. The game came from nowhere - humans made it up. Humans defined that ball in the rim is good, so you're happy, ball outside of the rim is not good, so you're sad. But why do we define such a rule if we all want happiness? It’s absurd. Everything is made up arbitrarily. There's no fundamental meaning to a plastic ball and a metal rim. We made up the meaning of all of these so that we can run and play. There is no meaning to any of this; it is just our minds desire meaning.If all meaning is made up, then I didn't want to play by anyone else's meaning. I defined my own. Ball in rim good, ball outside of rim also good, ball in anywhere good. No ball also good. Everything is good, ball or no ball. I decided that the meaning of the game is just to have fun and experience, and every moment of it is enjoyable.With this realization, I got up and started playing again, with my own rules. No longer did I feel the intense emotions up and down just because others thought that was how the game should go. I simply played and enjoyed the game, now with a sense of peace and joy.I enjoyed playing again with or without the basketball and making friends on the court, regardless of whether they were on my team or the opposing team. It didn't matter because we were all just players trying to have fun, although not everyone remembered that. Running around, feeling the fresh air on my face, and soaking up the sunshine and beautiful sky above was invigorating, and I loved feeling the sweat and energy my body was producing. Sometimes, I would take a break and sit on the sideline to rest and just do nothing. Every moment was perfect and enjoyable because that's how I defined it. I cherished every second of the game and stayed focused on the moment. There was no fundamental meaning, and that was okay. I simply had fun and enjoyed the game while I am on the court.Tl;dr: there’s no fundamental meaning to life. And that’s ok. It’s just our mind desires meaning, and you are free to define your own to make yourself happy.",,4/2/2023,47,1166,29,Indians Issue,Depressed
Google,Kvje65,Gay Single Struggling,"I have been out since my early 20s (no trauma) and I’m approaching my mid 30s. I’m mixed race and fit the gay stereotype of a ‘tall fit jock’ look. I’ve never had a relationship or had anything intimate beyond a hookup. I have been able to make friends each year (platonic) and keep them going but never had any attraction to them.I was very career focused and hookup focused thinking something would have worked out by now. I invested a lot into myself: therapy (to deal with anything in the past although there isn’t much), gym (I got the ‘Instagram’ muscled body and have kept it), hobbies/interests (especially travelling to places I wanted to visit) and so on.I did try dating apps like Tinder, I get a lot of matches but they all flake so I didn’t even land a physical date until I moved to the US (in my 30s). I moved to the US, to NY, thinking it would help reset things but I’m in the same boat of singleness. Getting hookups is still very easy.What I am noticing is the guys are just very much not a match e.g. I’m not attracted, no similar goals etc because my ‘type’ typically is taken by now (why wouldn’t they be?) which had left me on the curb. I can ‘settle’ but generally what is ‘left’ is probably not a match (ie guys dealing with trauma etc and projecting onto me which happens a lot) and it seems like a lost cause. Therapists agree with this when I show them the chats / I’m not being a jerk. I’m also sexually fetishised so it’s hard for men to look beyond that and see me as more which is frustrating. A lot of guys are simply in open relationships etc so even after a hookup even if they like me we can’t do anything because they are already emotionally taken.I’ve been to dating coaches, more therapists and even matchmakers all who are completely confused why I am only seen as a sex object and not a partner given I have a lot to offer a relationship beyond my physicality. I’m always told ‘it’s them not you’ which is even more frustrating.As a result of this eternal singleness I find myself kinda defocused / demotivated (outside of work) because I am distracted by apps but with no result. I’m struggling to accept that I may just be single forever and no one is a match and despite anything I try to improve myself I just won’t find anything. I do fill the time with as much other stuff as I can to keep occupied but there is a still a part of me that wants more.I’m struggling to accept this as I am a type A and believe if you work hard you should get some result so it’s kinda hurting inside more and more that literally nothing is working out whatever I do.",,5/3/2023,24,607,6,Therapist Issue,Therapy

Apple,blueca,How to ask kids to surrender electronics before bed,"Found two nights in a row that my son is sleeping with laptop next to him in bed. The laptop is open with a video stopped. I went to his room at 3am and 5am and saw this.Tried to talk to him to put his electronics outside his bedroom before going to bed. He refused. He is a teenager and is quite strong. It is hard to force him. But it is not healthy to allow him to do this. He ha missed several days of school and missed homework. He has a F, a B, and 3 A’s. His lack of sleep has led to depression, according to my psychologist (he himself refused to see a psychiatrist or psychologist, so we cannot get an accurate diagnosis).My psychologist suggested to call 988 or Santa Clara County Child Protective Services, and have him removed from our house and be placed in foster care, because he must obey our rules to live in our house. He is bullying us as the last time we took his electronics he broke my phone. I feel it is extreme but am considering trying.Are there any other methods? What about staying with him in a hotel room so we can make sure he sleeps without watching videos? He sleeps at around 2-3 am everyday for the past 4 months already. This gets worse in weekend, sometimes he would play music instruments and web surf all weekend without doing any homework, and did not go to school on Monday because he had not done any homework.Any suggestions welcome!#depression #mentalhealth",,2/18/2023,172,3078,20,Bullying,Mental Health

He also jokingly said that his back up plan was to wait few more years and have his son sponsor his Greencard (son is born in US).This morning, he had a massive heart attack, and didn’t make it. 😞 we are all shell shocked.This hit me specially hard since we were just joking around 2 days before this. We were discussing the latest season of boys, and talking about the epic fight of HL versus SB/Billy/Hughie and he said he couldn’t wait to see what happens next.So many things left unfinished… he didn’t see the season finale of boys, he didn’t get to see his green card (still waiting to receive it in mail), still waiting to join his dream job (cannot change job family as per visa restrictions), did not get to see his son graduate, did not lose the extra 20 pounds he put on during the pandemic…His family is completely shattered… damn I couldn’t stop the tears when I saw his kid’s face… We are still trying to figure out what needs to be done… take his body to India or if we should cremate here and spread ashes in India.

"Ooma, Inc.",oogieboogi,Stressful mother-in-law,"My wife is a first generation Asian immigrant. God I love her but her mother is stressing me out. Every time, we have family FaceTime.

Amazon,IVdv80,My unpopular opinion about ADHD,"Background: a women grew up in China with a pretty typical Chinese family that believes in hard working and doesn’t believe mental health.I can’t really share my opinions with others since it’s quite unliberal. Wanna share here to vent. My sample size is quite small. Would love to know more about other people’s experiences.All of sudden, sooooo many people in their late 20s or early 30s around me diagnosed with ADHD in the past 2-3 years. For some of them, that’s all they talk about it now, which is a little bit annoying but most fine. I believe mental health & mental disorder in general and support being open about it.What make me feel pissed are:1. some of them started blaming all of their failures to ADHD, maybe I’m thinking too much, but I feel they hinted that their “successful” friends are doing better than them is because they don’t have ADHD.2. They blame all of their rude behaviors to ADHD, not pay attention to others, interrupt people a lot etc. The way they talk about it is asking you to be understanding since they can’t change that.3. As a comparison, 2 of my close friends diagnosed with ADHD since they were kids, and they basically never talk about it other than occasionally complain Adderall made them hard to fall asleep. They both are successful in their fields and rarely interrupt others.4. Personal reason, possible the most important& selfish reason. I have symptoms of ADHD. I procrastinate a lot, I fidget my hands, I had trouble telling left and right when I was kid etc. I tried to be diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school and as an adult using an online service. They both came back as I don’t have ADHD. I just have trouble get up and do things as an adult and my brain developed a little different but overall normal as a kid. I had to tough through many super late nights to finish tasks last minute. My performance at school&work fluctuated a lot but overall good. In general, I feel all I go through is quite normal and most of my peers share the same struggle.Not diagnosed with ADHD is actually a relief to me that confirms my assumption that being lazy is a common struggle and some people is abusing ADHD for their flaws. I’m proud of myself and my peers who are responsible for our own flaws.——-Something confuses me but can’t find answer on google. Google answers are very general that lazy & procrastination is not your fault, and you probably have ADHD even you don’t have problem concentrating on a lot of things. However, I feel most people are lazy, tend to procrastinate and can’t concentrate on boring things. does that mean most people have ADHD? That doesn’t make sense to me since ADHD is supposed to be a brain disorder spectrum that only affects a small amount of people. Will be happy to be educated if you know more about this.Another question I wanna ask. Are ADHD diagnoses abused by those online services for their own benefit? In my knowledge, ADHD is a pretty serious mental disorder that often shows symptoms when the person is young, like they would just get and leave in the middle of a class. I remember I went through a few hours of testing to find out if I had ADHD when I was a kid. For now, it’s so easy to get diagnosed and prescribed online. When I was going through the online service recently, I feel I can easily exaggerating my symptoms and get the prescription. The online therapist I saw was actually really responsible that she told me that many people just ask for Adderall but she doesn’t support it.That’s all I wanna vent. Thanks for reading. Hope you all have a great day!#adhd",,3/16/2023,53,3620,54,Family Issue,ADHD

Meta,r2d2urit,"I've done it, I've won at life","Non-tech here.I've not been on any other website where (most) everyone makes six figures, so when I found Blind, I was fascinated. I was initially surprised to see most all messages were complaints and unhappiness, which intrigued me, but I suppose I should have known that all income levels can be equally unhappy.So I thought I'd join the minority and write a post about how I like my life, and feel I have already won.I'm married with two kids. Wife and I usually get along. Kids are both healthy and excel in school, and are also social with good friends. At least one of the kids I can see going to a top university when they are older. We are both employed and both make six figures, we are both equally frugal and save the majority of our money and live a nice but simple lifestyle. I stopped drinking, smoking, and never did drugs or gamble. Same with the wife. I enjoy golfing with the boys almost every week, sometimes the kids join me at the driving range, but I'm not pushing too hard if they don't want. Golf is a life-long challenge that I've accepted and it gives me something to always improve at, and a great tool to network with a wide variety of people, and also provides motivation to stay healthy and in shape even when I'm old. And there is not much better of a feeling than smashing a driver perfectly down the middle and watching the ball travel for miles.My career never had the trajectory of an executive, but I somehow lucked out and got called by Meta at the perfect time, where I could really focus on interview prep and got the job. I'm about a year in, and it's very much a dream job compared to anywhere I've worked. I'm a nobody there, no title, no big job, but it is a great company where even the lowest of the low can make a great life.It's not all sunshine and rainbows.The lovey-dovey stuff with the wife faded a few years ago. The kids refuse to clean up after themselves, so the house is never clean, and it's often a battle to get them to help with anything around the house. The wife got sucked into big work projects, so hasn't had as much time for the rest of us, has even graduated into working on the weekends. I can tell that she is a great employee and works at a level way above her pay grade. In a year or two, she will get a big pay bump, either at her current company or will leave to where she is paid appropriate to market demand.On the weekdays, I'm up at 5:30am to work out, then go to work, come home and cook/eat dinner with the family, do some studying of a second language or practice soccer with the boy, then in bed around 9:30-10pm. On the weekends, it's groceries, mowing the lawn, cleaning the house, kids soccer games, golf with the buddies, sometimes board games with the kids or they play with their friends. I try to keep a consistent sleep schedule so it makes waking up pretty easy, I haven't needed an alarm clock for quite a while.TC: 170, combined 330YOE: 18LCOL",170000,7/24/2022,742,78500,2032,Family Issue,Others

New,WeF67,Relationship with family,"My family constantly prevented from going out with friends. I didn’t get proper mentorship from the family as they’re immigrants with little knowledge of the us culture. There was a huge hole in my life from the loss of my mother at a young age. Unfortunately, there wasn’t anyone to help me cope with it. My entire life I’ve been anxious, doubtful with no self esteem since then.Sometimes I think negatively of my family for practically abandoning me and preventing my growth by getting friends. I hate my family because of it. I still love them, I think. I feel at ease with them and they love me. I just show them my side that I’m just serious all the time and don’t talk too much.This has caused me to suffer quietly so much at work, mentally, socially etc. For my career, I have had to learn many things the hard ways e.g. avoid taking commission based jobs, don’t take jobs with bad reviews, etc. Socially, I haven’t learned how to make and keep friends. This has kept me single at 35 years old. As a male this is viewed as low status. It makes me nervous to open up to a future gf about this.Therapist has helped me tremendously. I’m still upset I have wasted some of the best years of my life due to my circumstances.Typically, I spend my days behind a computer or phone completely isolated. Toastmasters has helped me with my communication skills. I have some serious issues speaking up when there was a problem. This mindset has been incredibly toxic to the point where there were unchecked negative thoughts swirling in my mind.I had to move out in my mid twenties in order to start building my life. The family wasn’t helpful at all. There was constant arguments about what I should be doing with my life. Any time I would bring up something, I’d get lectured about everything I’m doing wrong. I would get judged constantly about even the smallest details. They would be incredibly annoying.I don’t think I’ve ever really enjoyed life.

Snowflake,iamyself,How to focus on work when there is a lot of family ruckus?,"I have lots of plan for my career, I want to aggressively grow towards it. But unfortunately, I have a very aggressive and impulsive mother, I care for her and I call her every day and every night. But all she does is name calling & accuse me for all the problems in her life. I’m sick and tired of this happening like 9 on 10 days. I pity her because she lost her father when she was very young and my sibling is a case of cerebral palsy. She has always been under antidepressants and sleeping pills, maybe the drugs are making her even more cranky.I have been bearing this environment all my life and I thought if I have a good career, she will feel happy and we ultimately will have peace in life. But this is clearly not happening, I am stressed and anxious all the time. I have so much of expectations from myself but whenever I try to distance myself to focus on my work, I am being quoted as selfish and mean. She says she was troubled all her life to manage so many responsibilities to educate us and now all we care about is ourselves. BTW I am Indian girl so the family also thinks that they have done a huge favour on me by educating me because mostly Indian girls get married off without proper education. I mean it when I say I got absolutely no support for my US Master’s, they did support me until B. tech though. And now she claims all of my success, I have got no cheerleaders, no one who would even admire me a bit. I feel so much stuck between an emotional and practical dilemma, as if I either give up my life to her, to unsuccessfully and incessantly please her. Or just live in peace and do something that makes me feel accomplished. No matter what I do, anyways in her eyes, I’ll never be a son.But yes, she did send me to school and despite her mental illness, she had dreams of educating me well that has led me here. What she claims is it’s my turn to pay it back. And no matter what I try, she is just not happy, and I always get cursed. I’m a working person, so it’s given that I would mostly have morning and night times for her, but she would just hung up on me whenever I’ll say I am going for a meeting or have some work. Sometimes, I just hate my life because she has given it, and I want to return it to her. All this is just draining me in all possible ways and have made me sleep deprived, anxious and stressed all the time. I don’t want to be a b**ch who would abandon her for mental illness but I am just seeking peace, it’s affecting my personal life, my married life, my career, everything. I feel stuck!I’m trying to pamper her, supporting her financially, in all possible ways but it’s just not working. And in my head, I yield to this chaos everytime because I’m scared of losing her.

Meta,bg2wf6,Burnt out too? Sharing some things I’m trying:,"Literally every day, I see a post on blind about being burnt out and exhausted. I’m one of them as well. I knew if I didn’t stop, I’d end up in the hospital from burnout. Over the past few months, I’ve been reading up, learning and crowdsourcing ways to deal with this. I’m sharing some things I’m trying and hopefully this helps inspire others to share their experience and make progress towards feeling better.😓Recognize where your burnout is coming from.I’ve learnt that many of us who are burnt out are high achievers, people pleasers and perfectionists. We feel a need to constantly (over)achieve, prove ourselves and be helpful. For me, recognizing this was my own self-imposed expectations and I was driving myself too hard, and often unnecessarily, was helpful.🙃🙅‍♀️This is hard but I literally told myself each morning it’s okay to fail. It’s okay to not get an exceeds. Heck, I even said it’s okay if I lose my job (I’m on visa, have a dependent spouse and all that good stuff). You’ll be okay. Don’t tell yourself all the reasons you need to continue to push yourself. Instead, de-escalate the situation for yourself. Funnily, the more I did that, the more productive I became.🌼When burnt out, I realized that I was pushing myself even harder when I had no fuel in my tank. This was counterproductive. My perfectionism meant I would procrastinate and wait to be in the right mental state to begin tasks. This resulted in even greater stress. Do what you can. Start where you are. Try the pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break). Use the app Focus Keeper to just start.🤦🏼‍♀️ This sounds crazy but do not take on more things at work! Find 1-2 core impact things and do fewer things but make them count. Literally, don’t drive yourself harder!😵‍💫 Not just at work but if you’re an overachiever, you’re likely trying to excel in many part of your life all at once. Being an incredible parent, maybe ambitions to travel, buy a home, save, cook more, work - phew! Make a list of what is a priority today and what a not a priority today. Protect your energy, especially when it’s minimal to begin with.🤯Have you completed your stress cycle? One of the most helpful podcasts I heard helped articulate that dealing with stressors (the cause) is not the same as dealing with the stress (the feeling). Even if you eliminate the stressful situation, you still need to deal with the emotional stress. I realized I was stuck in past trauma because I hadn’t recognized my emotions. Listen to this podcast here which talks about ways to deal with the stress:https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L48OhNvYeIlv7Tir3yij0?si=ltvkkavVTx2_a0oVvedSUw🥰 Hopefully you’re here because you want to feel better. Keep promises to yourself. You’ve probably abandoned your own boundaries long enough. Win your own trust back. In all likelihood, you’re a people pleaser and are constantly compromising yourself for your work and for others. If you say you’re going to end work by 5, do it. Walk? Do it. Put yourself over other things (for a change).✨Watch Stutz, the documentary on Netflix if you haven’t. Beautiful. And it’ll resonate if you’re looking for answers. It’s Jonah Hill’s documentary about his wise and actionable therapist who provides very helpful tools in a compelling way.Other seemingly simple things to try:🫡 Stop surrounding yourself with negative things. Delete blind (oh the irony!). If you can’t, limit to 30 mins of doomscrolling. Same thing with news/ LinkedIn/ Social Media (there is such a thing as too much self-help content that makes you feel like you’re constantly in need of ‘fixing’). Watch what you consume. Make your recovery your priority.🤣Watch funny things. Literally.🦋Nourish yourself (food, soul and all) on a day to day basis. Don’t wait for the weekend.📝Lots to do? Yes. Make a list of just 3 things both big and small. Just get through it, unemotionally even. Just execute. It’s okay.🧘🏼‍♀️Find ways to regulate your nervous system. It’s likely overstimulated. You’re likely having exaggerated responses. It’s in fight or flight. Breathe consciously, prioritize your sleep. And if you can help it, try not to make it worst with coffee or alcohol.🙋‍♂️Ask for help. I’ve realized so many I’ve reached out to have been open to talking about their experience. Find a therapist, a friend to confide in. Also know when you need to really press the brakes hard (long term leave? taking a pause from work? If you need it, prioritize it to the extent possible).👋Find a hobby to do with your hands. There must be something you’d have considered: tennis? Puzzles? Painting? Art? Cooking? Fixing things around the house? Decluttering? Helping your kids with a project?🌻Of course, walk, be in nature, find ways to connect to people who lift you up. Your kids, friends, pets, loved ones.Hope this helps provide a starting point if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Just some things I’ve gathered from others, I’m trying myself and am paying it forward. Others feel free to chime in!#burnout",,3/2/2023,28,1711,88,Family Issue,Stress

Lately we’ve noticed they started copying almost everything from us and also other distant friends. We ignored initially but now it is reached a point where we’re started laughing on it. Still we’ve never mentioned it to them nor made it affect our friendship.In terms of relationship, all our new contacts are always shared with them and they also befriend them.Past 2 months they’ve started making new friends and started ignoring us. They also do not invite us when they meet them and never introduced them. Even though we’ve this everytime in the past. If we invite them for a meet after 2 weeks they avoid saying they have plans with new friends.Today her wife told my wife by mistake something really weird. She said while talking to her husband she mentioned him that X should not be done otherwise “whatever is left in our friendship” will be over. She immediately tried to correct that statement she shared by mistake and avoided further discussions.I’ve gone through all recent conversations and noticed this behaviour of copying and comparing started when I moved from their company to Meta and they’re still at the same company. They have also tried to bring me down everytime they meet recently and try to bring down random Meta related research, posts etc. I never return the same gesture and just politely ignore this behavior.Not sure what has led to this behavior from them which is negatively impacting our friendship. People should not be comparing on small things specially with friends. I’ve tried to communicate this to them through many indirect ways but doesn’t seem ti be working.Please help me in rebonding with them and removing this obstacle which has led to this weird toxic behavior in them which I never expected.",,4/19/2023,33,977,1,Immigration Issue,Others
Google,bdI58gKk,Attracted to my therapist 🥲,"I started seeing a therapist several months ago. I was going through mild depression, anxiety and just in general having too much stress and burnout from work.As we went through different sessions, she probed for deeper and very personal topics I never disclosed with anyone else, like my insecurities and all my ""flaws"". Initially I only shared surface-level stuff, but over time I opened up and shared more and more. Then all of a sudden the floodgates opened and I broke down in front of her a couple times, putting myself in an extremely vulnerable position.She is extremely empathetic, caring and loving. I feel like I'm melting whenever she comforts and looks at me with so much care in her eyes. I KNOW it's her job to do this. I KNOW I'm just a client to her. Or, could there be more to this? Regardless, it doesn't change the fact that I'm now very attracted to her and look forward to her sessions more than anything.She is definitely younger than me and probably single.

New,tKwlvb,"Some confessions. Been gay & closeted whole life. Sharing thoughts, reflections, and regrets","I’m 30 and I have been gay & closeted my whole life. Maybe 2-3 close friends know, but not in details. And 1-2 people have openly suspected but I brushed it off.Looking back, I wish I were more open to exploring and true to myself. I’m looking back at missed opportunities — including a friend who died from an accident right before I was ready to come out to and share my feelings towards him after months/years of processing my feelings for him.There were a lot of guys in my life (friends/acquaintances/classmates) that I found attractive but i distanced myself from them once I started developing feelings, but I also recently learnt that a lot of straight men are open to exploring, so I wish I had made moves on people who I found attractive, or at least put myself more out there at a gay bar or something like Grindr. I don’t even feel confident about putting my pics on an app like Grindr, so I just hold conversations for a couple of days until we have to meet - then I ghost them or make up some excuse to not see them.I have wasted and am still wasting my prime years, which personally freaks me out a bit and now I feel like I want some answers for myself.I have always pursued and still do want to have a conventional lifestyle — a stable 9-5, well-paying jobs, generally passing as straight, and nice person. Maybe get married to a nice woman.But I just recently started feeling like I am a fraud and have abandoned(?) myself in order to just fit into society and fit into the narrative that feels comfortable. I’m not sure which decision would really make me happy. I ran into some men on Grindr who are married but enjoy having sex with men - maybe I might become one of them.Sexually, I’m very inactive and inexperienced. I’m a virgin on both sides, but have given several BJ’s to one of my middle school friends who I think is either curious or gay, not sure. After a few times, he pretended it never happened and gaslit me into thinking only I wanted it. This incident actually took a toll on me and made it harder for me to get intimate with others.Then I had a girlfriend once in college but the relationship didn’t last long. She was a great person and while we don’t stay in touch, I genuinely wish her the best and hope she meets someone that deserves her and will treat her well.At 30, or almost 31, I feel genuinely lost. I don’t know what I want, feel scared to experiment or put myself out there either as a straight man (I.e. hooking up with women to see if this is what I like) or as a bi/gay man (I.e. experimenting with men, full on). There’s a lot that I want to balance — the narrative I want to keep, figuring out what I really want, and not having any ire regrets on missed connections/opportunities/relationships.There’s been a lot of traumatic events in my family in my 20s, so I am always anxious and also afraid of finding someone who will be okay with my baggage. So I see myself building walls around me and not letting myself cross the wall or allowing others to cross it, as it’s easier to fit into the narrative of I wont get married. I’m just scared of bad and sad things happening in general.Not sure where I’m going with this but just wanted to rant for a bit as I am having some form of a quarter/mid-life crisis lately.TC 250k",250000,5/3/2023,13,618,8,Family Issue,Anxiety

Northrop Grumman,O(n!)Ag,Try mushrooms everyone,"Mushrooms help your brain work differently by significantly decreasing the activity in a specific area of the brain called the default mode network (DMN).This makes your brain use significantly less energy to switch between different mental states, leading to a more flexible way of thinking. As a result, it makes it easier to make new connections and overcome obstacles you couldn't before. It tears down walls you probably have built up, some of which you probably aren’t aware of. This flexible thinking lasts for weeks after doing the drug (known as the integration period). So you have an opportunity to change yourself during this window.This is helpful for people struggling with anxiety, depression, or other issues, especially during these job layoffs.Something to consider.. that is my PSATC 150k#mentalhealth",150000,4/26/2023,20,565,3,Layoff Issue,Anxiety

At work, I don't have my own interests and will mostly do what others told me to do, or what I think will reflect best on me.And that fucking perfectionism!

I don't hold any grudges and have tremendous respect for work of others, but on the inside I'm crying from helplessness, cause I want the same.And that procrastination...

A few years ago I worked as hard as I could, giving hours and hours, but I was still miles away from some coworkers, who were much smarter or much better socially. So now, I sometimes cannot focus on the task, there's some inner resistance in me that says, why? It will end up just the same.

It didn’t matter how technically proficient I became, I didn’t have the musical voice that others had. At best I probably could’ve been a music teacher or something, but there was no way I could settle for that.It was a soul crusher. I looked around my little suburban town that I wasted my teenage years on, and left the whole town behind. I (unrightfully) resented the entire town for years - well into my 20’s - because I associated it with what I thought was a failure.An upside to this is that I’ve since re-discovered visual arts - something that I temporarily gave up on when I discovered music. Visual arts has been a guiding light for me ever since. I basically work with it the same way that I wanted to with music, but I can do it with a fraction of the effort.Tell me about your broken dreams and new directions it’s led you to.",,4/29/2023,20,247,2,Others,Others

Everything is good between us.We are about to get married in end of this year. Lately, every now and then something bothers me. She has anxiety and depression.

I do find her getting depressed like twice a month when she just locks herself in room and need assurance that I love her. She had very traumatic past - was molested, had couple of bad relationship and toxic workplace. She told me about these and was transparent. I do like her but her medicines and mental condition sometime stresses me a lot. Thinking about future especially during pregnancy put a lot of stress on me. I did talk with her psychiatrist and he told me that she is doing well and should be out of medicine within 6-8 months but these things can relapse and we should meet with him before planning for pregnancy. She do daily gym, focus a lot on her mental and physical health but sometime (twice/thrice a month) it is just out of her control. During that time, she just cries and keep on crying and need me to hug her and say nice things to her.If you have read through this, thanks a lot.

New,d4vinci,I live in constant anxiety at work now,"Last year, I started a job at a small start up in March and then got laid off in November around the time Facebook and Amazon announced their layoffs. One of the reasons they said was because I didn't deliver well enough and it was a huge blow to my self-esteem.I just started a new job a month ago and the first month was fine, however, I did make some small mistakes. My manager is a Type A, high performer, execution-type of employee and every meeting with her is always a tactical one where she expects movement. I've also made small mistakes on some tasks she's given me and the more she points out the mistakes, the more stressed I get, which leads to more mistakes.I am now living in constant fear of losing my job again. My manager now invites our senior manager to our meetings when I am reviewing things with her (only happened once so far but another one happening today). Part of it is definitely my overthinking but I know I can't be straightforward with them and tell them that this is causing me stress because then they will wonder if I am fit enough to do my job. I have a lot of life plans planned out because of this job and it would be a huge blow if I lost it even though I would be financially fine.

Google,sad🍰triggr,Stop my self pity,"Toxic blinders, I call upon you to beat me up with your tough love and get me to stop feeling bad about myself.- I grew up below the poverty line in the US, a family of 5 with combined household income of $13K annually, sharing a 500sf 1-bedroom cockroach infested apartment.- I had a narcissistic, gaslighting and physically abusive father, who would beat up my mom and my siblings. Police put him in jail after my older sister called the cops on him.- Older sister is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is emotionally volatile, and would also beat me up even after my dad left. She has addictions, thinks the world owes her something, and actively resents me bc of how different our life outcomes have been.- I wrote college essays about how much my life sucked and got into two Ivy League schools (Columbia, Princeton) for undergrad and grad. This caused my sister to hate me even more. She flunked out of school and has never properly been gainfully employed.- We grew up with no support systems. No aunts, no uncles, no cousins, no grandparents. No family friends or neighbors due to my narcissist and physically abusive father trying to isolate us. Very isolated. I was an introvert and escaped into books / schoolwork as escapism from my abusive family life. Was a scholarship student at a private school for rich kids and hid my home life from everyone.- My Super conservative, hyper religious mother blamed me for “ruining her life” after dad left following his domestic violence prison stint. She is very verbally abusive to this day, calling me a wh***, son of ***, b***, and a worthless slu* everytime I’ve introduced her to a romantic partner. Mom is also financially abusive — sees me as her retirement fund. Made me empty my bank account to buy her a house (but she put the deed in my older sister’s name because she thinks my sister needs inheritance since I can take care of myself). Mom has remarried and now financially abuses and verbally abuses my well-meaning (formerly widowed) step-dad.- I’ve had high profile well paying jobs in Wall Street and Silicon Valley (Investment banking and big tech). However, I’ve been functionally fired from every single job I’ve ever had because of conflicts with my supervisor.- I’ve started doing therapy and I suspect my inability to hold down a job is related to my PTSD, anxiety, depression and various conditions of childhood trauma. I don’t do well with authority figures or rules. I’ve always denied and resisted the idea of my failings relating to my childhood because I’ve spent most of my life blocking out my dysfunctional family. But I don’t think I can be avoidant about it anymore. It’s indisputable that I am booksmart / intelligent, and that I produce very high quality work. But I lack soft skills. people (especially supervisors) hate me. Peers tend to like me. I suspect I’m on autism spectrum as well. I lash out at people at work when I see them playing office politics and I call people out on their bullshit. At first I thought I just had bad managers but now I think that the problem must be me.- I’ve had 2 long-term relationships (5 years, 3 years). I genuinely think that they both loved me and vice versa during the actual course of the relationships. However, during the actual breakup / separation of both of these two relationships, I’ve done really emotionally abusive things to both of them. I tuned into a different, vindictive, evil person during the breakups. To the extent where they’ve gotten restraining orders against me after I’ve dumped them.I’m sad because I feel like whatever shit happened to me in childhood has left me into such a non-functioning adult. I’ve lived my whole life determined that my past / family wouldn’t define my future and that hope is what kept me going. But now I am depressed and resigned. I am a failed adult and there’s no one to blame but myself. I somehow get these good jobs but I just can’t keep them bc it seems that the toxic gaslighting of corporate culture at work triggers me into behaving erratically or unprofessionally to the point where my supervisors hate me or I get fired. I honestly think I am a decent girlfriend but I become crazy during break ups. I’m 29 and single. I don’t even want to date anyone anymore because I’d feel bad for whoever winds up with me.Sometimes I feel suicidal. I’m the problem. It’s me. I don’t fit into society. I keep getting good jobs but then getting into supervisor conflicts. I think if I had grown up well adjusted maybe I could have used my natural intelligence to be successful. But everything triggers me and I just self-sabotage.I feel like a broken toy. Unfixable. I’m in a stage of self-pity and giving up (bc I feel like my childhood trauma is not fixable). I’m very self aware but I lack impulse control. I may have inherited the bipolar disorder or the anger management issues from my dad/sister. But the psych won’t diagnose me with them bc they think I just have many ptsd triggers.Regardless, I still don’t fit into society as a sane, functioning adult. I fixated on TC bc I grew up poor. I have a good NW at 29 despite getting fired so many times bc of getting high TCs since I was 22.

I don’t like how my manager is giving feedback, but on a rationale it’s all fits however by tone of voice, length of feedback and feedback to issue ratio is disproportionate I feel like she is just enjoying talking from an upper position but I can’t formulate a legit feedback towards it other than “lengthy feedback for Minor issues demotivates me” then she proceededs to talk about how that issue not minor is. -but it’s about 1-2 hour behind lagging work like wtf? We’re not on a production line?!-Also she encourages to talk about ideas and feelings but also says not that they will be acted upon each time and 99% they’re not heard. So everything by the book but feels so plastic. some say let’s thrive to be authentic ourselves etc but if communicating is so grift how can we be not like robots?And what scares me is if you work long enough like this you become a corporate robot even in your personal life and you distance yourself from your original and pure thoughts by always framing them, selecting them, evaluating them based on goals; outcomes and everything..

I'm so fed up with this rat race, and want a different pace of my life.I've had quite a career ride. Coming to the US as a refugee 20+ year ago, I've had to work 60+ hours/week to pay for school and living. Getting a job in the high tech industry after my Ph.D. where the tax I pay every year is 5x more than what my father made. It was a dream.The last 2 years just got me.

My mom had worked 2 jobs since she got to the US, and shedidn't have time to really enjoy her life or had chance to see her grand kids growing up.I want to spend more time with my family, see my kids growing up, and see the wrinkles develop on my wife's face every day. I want them to see the smiles on my face, and we talk about the things we experience on the day at dinner table instead of my stressed face and all my complaints about work.

Google,AmazonConv,His count of enchanted objects diminished by one.,"Everyone should read the Great Gatsby, it’s a classic and pretty short. Great novel about wealth, faking wealth, inequality, performative personality, and more. Lots of great ideas that will help you survive the Bay Area/Seattle/New York/LA type places if you didn’t grow up there.Anyways, the quote specifically is from a scene in the book (spoilers). Gatsby grew up poor but loved this one girl, but she would not date him since he was poor. He spent his entire life pursuing wealth and bought a mansion across a lake from her, from his bedroom he could see a bright green light on her dock across the lake. That green light represented her to him, his desires for her, etc. He eventually wins the girl and they have sex, and later he looks out at the green light and does not feel anything. “Now again it was just a green light on the dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.”I would sit here an wax about my love for the book - the reason for this post is there are definitely some of you dealing with this. You pursued something and now that you have it, you don’t have something to pursue which can leave you feeling hollow and driveless. It’s not just you. It’s literally a major theme in this classic book.It’s ok. Frankly if you’re feeling this way, chances are your obsession with that goal wasn’t healthy anyways. You just couldn’t realize it until you achieved it. But you’re not alone. Just reflect on your achievements and find a healthy way to set your next goal.Tc $470k",,5/10/2023,7,137,4,Indians Issue,Others

Google,sad🍰triggr,Stop my self pity,"Toxic blinders, I call upon you to beat me up with your tough love and get me to stop feeling bad about myself.- I grew up below the poverty line in the US, a family of 5 with combined household income of $13K annually, sharing a 500sf 1-bedroom cockroach infested apartment.- I had a narcissistic, gaslighting and physically abusive father, who would beat up my mom and my siblings. Police put him in jail after my older sister called the cops on him.- Older sister is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is emotionally volatile, and would also beat me up even after my dad left. She has addictions, thinks the world owes her something, and actively resents me bc of how different our life outcomes have been.- I wrote college essays about how much my life sucked and got into two Ivy League schools (Columbia, Princeton) for undergrad and grad. This caused my sister to hate me even more. She flunked out of school and has never properly been gainfully employed.- We grew up with no support systems. No aunts, no uncles, no cousins, no grandparents. No family friends or neighbors due to my narcissist and physically abusive father trying to isolate us. Very isolated. I was an introvert and escaped into books / schoolwork as escapism from my abusive family life. Was a scholarship student at a private school for rich kids and hid my home life from everyone.- My Super conservative, hyper religious mother blamed me for “ruining her life” after dad left following his domestic violence prison stint. She is very verbally abusive to this day, calling me a wh***, son of ***, b***, and a worthless slu* everytime I’ve introduced her to a romantic partner. Mom is also financially abusive — sees me as her retirement fund. Made me empty my bank account to buy her a house (but she put the deed in my older sister’s name because she thinks my sister needs inheritance since I can take care of myself). Mom has remarried and now financially abuses and verbally abuses my well-meaning (formerly widowed) step-dad.- I’ve had high profile well paying jobs in Wall Street and Silicon Valley (Investment banking and big tech). However, I’ve been functionally fired from every single job I’ve ever had because of conflicts with my supervisor.- I’ve started doing therapy and I suspect my inability to hold down a job is related to my PTSD, anxiety, depression and various conditions of childhood trauma. I don’t do well with authority figures or rules. I’ve always denied and resisted the idea of my failings relating to my childhood because I’ve spent most of my life blocking out my dysfunctional family. But I don’t think I can be avoidant about it anymore. It’s indisputable that I am booksmart / intelligent, and that I produce very high quality work. But I lack soft skills. people (especially supervisors) hate me. Peers tend to like me. I suspect I’m on autism spectrum as well. I lash out at people at work when I see them playing office politics and I call people out on their bullshit. At first I thought I just had bad managers but now I think that the problem must be me.- I’ve had 2 long-term relationships (5 years, 3 years). I genuinely think that they both loved me and vice versa during the actual course of the relationships. However, during the actual breakup / separation of both of these two relationships, I’ve done really emotionally abusive things to both of them. I tuned into a different, vindictive, evil person during the breakups. To the extent where they’ve gotten restraining orders against me after I’ve dumped them.I’m sad because I feel like whatever shit happened to me in childhood has left me into such a non-functioning adult. I’ve lived my whole life determined that my past / family wouldn’t define my future and that hope is what kept me going. But now I am depressed and resigned. I am a failed adult and there’s no one to blame but myself. I somehow get these good jobs but I just can’t keep them bc it seems that the toxic gaslighting of corporate culture at work triggers me into behaving erratically or unprofessionally to the point where my supervisors hate me or I get fired. I honestly think I am a decent girlfriend but I become crazy during break ups. I’m 29 and single. I don’t even want to date anyone anymore because I’d feel bad for whoever winds up with me.Sometimes I feel suicidal. I’m the problem. It’s me. I don’t fit into society. I keep getting good jobs but then getting into supervisor conflicts. I think if I had grown up well adjusted maybe I could have used my natural intelligence to be successful. But everything triggers me and I just self-sabotage.I feel like a broken toy. Unfixable. I’m in a stage of self-pity and giving up (bc I feel like my childhood trauma is not fixable). I’m very self aware but I lack impulse control. I may have inherited the bipolar disorder or the anger management issues from my dad/sister. But the psych won’t diagnose me with them bc they think I just have many ptsd triggers.Regardless, I still don’t fit into society as a sane, functioning adult. I fixated on TC bc I grew up poor. I have a good NW at 29 despite getting fired so many times bc of getting high TCs since I was 22.

Looks like showing off, but at the cost of health and love.Since we started working on our first job after graduation, she always has the imposter syndrome, worried about not performing even on average. She has not been able to detach from work at all: always bring work back home before pandemic, always working until exhausted after midnight, always miss most lunches, eat very little even at dinner, always catching up the last minute when I need her to pick up kids or go to an appointment, never take a day off to take a break after busywork, ironically, when she left her last company, she barely used any vacation days and got a big pay out. Now her company has so called unlimited PTO, she only take sick leaves…She always feels needs to work and respond messages and email no matter whenever: at home, weekends, on beds, holidays, midnights.She always worries about not performing well at work even after she had been promoted twice , always exceeding, and got retention refresher even without another job offer.She used to not good at programming at college and needed my help with all her coding work. But she had been able to code well later at grad school and at work. But she still has a mindset thinking she is not a good engineer. I feel that she always tries to compare with me and then feel incompetent.She always work, never declines meeting at any time.Since we lived together as students, I’ve always been doing more housework, kids school pickup/drop off, bills, financial, grocery. By default it is always me pick up and drop off kids until they go to different schools, then she takes the closer school kid, but still always catches the last minute when picking up. Other things like kids’ doctors appointments, school events, are always on me. Housework, cooking and grocery, clean up dishes and table are by default on me. I love her, I am not complaining letting me do all of this by default. I want her to have more time to relax from work. But it doesn’t work as I expected: she uses all the time I save for her to work.I tried to talk to her about not working too much, mentioning I want to live healthy with her and become old together, work shouldn’t be all in our lives, nothing works.Then I intentionally stated fights and complaining she doesn’t do housework, cooking, kids school, grocery, paying bills, then she started doing a little bit very impatient and took these as wasting time… what I really wanted with these intentional fights is to get her off the work because I am so worried about her health when she can’t detach from work for even a minute.Sometimes she gets depressed at work she will watch tv, and play with me and kids, shopping, that’s the only time she is off work.She seems caring about her health too but for some reason she just feels like everyone will die eventually so hurting health is nothing different.I tried all I can think of but nothing changed.Nowadays she doesn’t even talk about the mental health and workaholic issues with me. I can’t suggest anything including seeing a psychiatrist. We still talk, just not about detaching from work. For a while I even thought she may be cheating but she never hides phone, emails, even work devices from me, nowadays we both work from home, she almost never go out alone, I can always know her location via phone and what she is doing.I can tell she is hurting her health, skin becomes stale and loose, losing hair, period gets delayed whenever work stresses, no sex unless weekends, easily lose patience with kids.I don’t know what to do. Tonight is another night that she works until 1am. And I tried to talk about work but she didn’t respond.",,2/1/2023,91,6088,45,Loneliness,Stress
New,SvyX20,Independence US culture,"Americans tend to put pressure on the individual to figure things out on their own. Society tends to leave them be if they’re quiet or displaying any sort of problems. This isn’t the type of culture to want to help bring one another up. Sometimes I get the impression that Americans enjoy seeing someone fall because at least it’s not them. Americans pride themselves on building xyz on their own, achieving great things on their own, etc. This culture is intoxicating for those that don’t have life figured out. These individuals would need someone to tap deep into their lives to get help.The advances in tech and now AI would potentially isolate these people further into their silos. This prevents them from getting help from other humans. Sometimes these isolated individuals would only need a human connection.Think about the homelessness today. There are people that end up suffering quietly. It’s common knowledge that Americans tend to be so close to being homeless or one emergency away from being broke.Men are increasingly having it difficult to adapt in todays society. Society seems more geared to allow women to flourish. Children advance differently according to their gender. Girls develop quicker and boys have more troubles keeping still. Two factors that get families to begin to compare the two genders. The school system isn’t conducive to allow for boys to remain “entertained” in school. Most of the boys would lose focus immediately and cause them to suffer in their grades. BigThink came up with a video recently on this topic. As Men get older the problem might get worse for them if they don’t have a solid support system.This American culture of independence is intoxicating for our wellbeing.TC: 65K 😎",65000,5/9/2023,11,152,1,Job Issues,Others

I always think about my work, but when I sit down to work, my focus wanders elsewhere. I’m not able to hold attention while in a conversation. This happens both at and outside of work.I finally decided to accept the reality and took couple of online assessments in the last couple of weeks, which confirmed my doubts.Tests asked that I seek treatment or therapy.I have the below few questions:What is the best approach to getting ADHD diagnosed/ treated? Should I reach out to a psychiatrist/psychologist? Or should I be working with a therapist?Can someone with ADHD have a successful career in Technology? What are the alternatives?At what point should I engage my employer’s HRShould my manager be made aware, and if yes, when?Are there any OTC medication available to help relieve the symptoms in the interim?My family is reliant on my paycheck.

I joined Stripe in a new role that I’d never done before. Got some training but not much. Very unclear expectations but I was told that if I’m underperforming, my manager will let me know.No performance concerns over the last year, even got a small bonus mid year for going above and beyond on a few things. But it appears that someone “flipped the bit” and I’m on the fast track to being put on a PIP out of the blue.Don’t want to get into all details here but I haven’t really enjoyed this role and have been looking to make an internal transfer for months and it hasn’t worked out due to HC freezes. I get nauseous every morning before work, absolutely dread it, and anxiety is at peak levels throughout the day. I feel like I can do nothing right at this point and they’re using anything they can to document subpar performance.It sounds so dumb to say all of this because I’m remote and the worst case scenario (being fired) doesn’t really have any major impact on my life as I’m a citizen, have savings, will eventually be able to find a job outside of Stripe, etc. I just really care about my role and doing a good job. I’m interview prepping now for eng roles but didn’t start until recently due to short notice of my awful performance, and I’m not totally ready to throw myself out there yet (but maybe I should).Would you stick it out until PIP/severance (if it doesn’t happen soon) or put in 2 weeks and GTFO before having something lined up? Am I being weak by wanting to just end the pain right now?Severance I think would be ~2 months of pay, but I’m sure they want to avoid that so I can see them ratcheting up the pain to make me want to leave before that point.EDIT - Wow, I didn’t expect this post to get so much visibility. It might be easy for my manager or coworkers to identify me but whatever. Lots of people asked what the role was. It’s a presales engineer role Stripe calls Solutions Architect. And I recently spoke with my manager and it sounds like this is all coming from higher up, not my manager’s decision. And long story short, I believe them. Which is different from how I think these situations usually work.EDIT EDIT - Also, some people sound like they’re in a similar or worse position.

I talked to HR and they told me that there are three conditions that need to be met for harassment case:1) The abuser exploited her power or position.2) The abuser's actions were beyond common sense (illegal actions, violent language, etc.).3) Mentally or physically the victim got hurt.#cribl #mentalharrasmentI asked HR if bringing in diagnosis from a doctor would prove the condition #3, and they said ""mental tolerance differs from person to person"" and ""diagnosis might include your damage from private life.""Cribl's HRBP are useless to the core.When I first Interviewed at Cribl, I get this feeling that it is a good company with good culture. But later realized all the awards were bought.My manager is one of the most disrespectful /impulsive/erratic person I've met in my career . Unfortunately, no one under her reporting structure can go to HR or skip level or VP as it's like a friends group at the top . It is so unfortunate to see such behavior not get flagged but also unfortunate that I/my peers have to live with it on a daily basis. I'm thinking of leaving the company because of the mental torture i am going through.My manager has bullied me on multiple occasions - shouting me down in 1:1s, gas lighting, aggressive in 1:1s,... She is a jerk.I don’t have proof of her behavior except for my notes from time to time. She is also did similar things to one of the coworker couple of months back and as a result that person is no longer in the team.And now everyone constantly lives in the fear of being fired or given a PIP. She blackmails members on her team to do exactly as she says and not talk back during meetings with other teams, otherwise “it will greatly impact our careers”. She micromanages everyone and lies to her skip about everything and throws the team under the bus to make herself look better and blames us for her poor execution decisions.At this point, I am convinced Cribl doesn’t give a shit about it’s employees.It is just so disheartening.

The manager talked to me about the issue and most of the conversation was a personal attack on me. He questioned my capabilities. He made fun of me. Overall, the feedback was not constructive. He reviews each and every PR of mine. There was never a situation where he identified a potential regression before checking in the code. But after we identify the regressions, he says this is missing and that is missing. I am feeling burned out.

Cerebral,pmlifts,You will never be happy if all you focus on is money.,"The common theme of all of the posts I read on here are ""550k TC but hate my life."" I believe this is because all everyone cares about on this app is money and clout. If those are the most important things in your life, I can promise you you'll never be happy. There are plenty of people who feel content and happy with a $90k household income, and there are a ton of miserable people with a $5m+ household income. If you have a mindset of lacking (i.e. ""my TC is $780k and I feel broke""), then you will ALWAYS be lacking. Conversely if you have a mindset of abundance REGARDLESS of your TC and find happiness in friends, family, travel, etc. then none of the other shit matters.On your death bed you're not going to wish you made more money—you're going to wish you spent more time with the people that you loved, that you lived a life of purpose, that you didn't waste so much time complaining. Remember that TIME is the only resource that no amount of money can buy more of.It's sad to see so many ""successful"" (by modern capitalistic definitions) people on here who are just trying to compete with one another and constantly chase more money while still feeling empty on the inside.

Almost all aspects suck.Work is has been heading down hill since my old manager and director left, and with support check ins and constant talks about layoffs it's hard to get work done (ironically).Wife and I have been constantly fighting because she was insistent on buying a house earlier this year. I kept having bad feelings about going through with it but ultimately said yes because I didn't want to stand between her and her dream of buying a house (she saved up for the entire down payment for years). We ended up grossly overpaying at the peak of the market (well above asking) and the monthly payments have been so brutal I've had to give up on all hobbies that I used to enjoy and can't spend any money without feeling guilty.Wife now admits she made a mistake but that doesn't help going forward. There's no way out of this house without either waiting years (7-10 years) for market to potentially recover or take a huge hit to start over somewhere cheaper (we're in the Bay Area). I can't help but resent her even though it was also my fault for ultimately agreeing to buying the house.We went to see a couple's therapist who basically added nothing of value and told me to ""get over"" my depression, and that even if we lost the house it would be OK, not something I really want to hear right now, especially with me fearing for my job as well.I kept telling her (before buying the house) that we should move to a cheaper area outside of the Bay Area so we have a better quality of life. She insisted on buying in the Bay Area for friends and family that she sees maybe once a month on average.Some days I wake up wishing I hadn't, other days I wish for a time machine to go back and slap myself for even considering a house this expensive (to give you an idea of how badly we fucked up, my half of mortgage + property tax is almost 80% of my take home pay).Feel free to make fun of my horrible decision making skills. #burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,12/19/2022,171,5465,71,Family Issue,Burnout

Microsoft,klon,"Unmotivated, Coasting, Lazy or?","At least for the last few years (if not much longer) have felt very unmotivated by work and feeling like a total slacker.I'm mid senior level in role and career (10+ years), but have never been a strategy person, a go getter, someone who takes initiative, goes above and beyond, etc. Have no desire to be a people manager, and my biggest driver for actually working is money (which is not a huge tech salary, but good enough for marketing roles at my level). I usually thrive when there is like a worskstream partner that leads and we can tag team, or when I'm on projects with very well defined scope, ownership, and I have a partner to run things by for validation. Those times in career is when I get promoted or nominated for awards. But a part of me feels like I didn't deserve it, because I couldn't have done it on my own.After being in previous role for several years, thought that the reason for feeling this way was not learning anything new and went through the very out of my comfortable zone process of switching teams. Had a ton of anxiety around the new role, the unknowns, totally new org, new products, customer base, etc. Now almost a year into it, I'm back to coasting and not really caring about this work. The fact that it's in an area that's in the news doesn't motivate me.My manager rattles off all these opportunities to dig into, and I continue to do the basics. I'm not really ""running my own business"" or being a mini CMO of things. I try to fluff up the minimal work I do and feel like a failure who will be called out any day now. There is almost like this need in me to resist the work, and instead of spending the free time to like go after a new projects, dig into something, go through some research, etc. I go on walks, manage my family life stuff and really engage when there is like a deadline, a meeting to prepare for, etc.Is this like a mid life crisis or something (I'm not even 40...)? Sometimes I think I'm just lazy and need to stop making excuses. So privilaged to have this ""looks great on paper job"" (especially after all the layoffs), with plenty of free time (I'm definetely not overworked), family, etc. I fake enthusiasm at work, wait until the weekends and trips.

I get so much anxiety around this. The anxiety is the future is so uncertain, and everything seems perfect now, but the lived experiences of others forecast the same fate for me, and I don’t like it.It doesn’t help that everyone that seems to have this bad ending never share their anecdote of what ended it for them. It’s like an ominous and eventual conclusion that they say is applicable to everyone.On a second note of anxiety, the falling out of love thing, it’s scary to me.

I really respect him, he’s had the exact career I want for myself and I really see him as a role model for how to manage a team, care for your employees while also challenging them, and has a career that I would like to replicate (in terms of projects, not industry). He’s also quite critical of shortcomings he sees in other teams and is open about it with me, which scares me about his perception of me when I fuck up, which happens once in a while.The problem I have with this characterization of myself is that it’s given me severe imposter syndrome, something I hadn’t felt since my PhD days. While it initially felt nice to hear that, I now can’t stop being paranoid about every mistake and I now try to be a perfectionist. I will occasionally make mistakes and I can’t stop the self flagellation that then comes when it does happen. Also I feel like he thinks I’m significantly smarter than I actually am. I assume whatever mistake I’ve made has shattered his opinion of me (false, I know, since he’s told me many times that he’s happy with the quality of my work and the load I can take off his plate) and totally destroyed all faith he had placed on me.It really sucks to feel this way.I really like my job, it’s a lot of fun, I work on interesting high impact projects, have great WLB, but whenever I make a mistake my week is ruined 😟.Anyway, I know I have impostor syndrome and it’ll go away with time.

Among other topics, i casually mentioned how my kids staying at home(vs going to school) can be a little disruptive to my workday. She asked me how old my kids were, i told her. And then i asked her if she had kids. ‘What about you, you have kids?’- was my question verbatim.

I had an opportunity to collaborate work with a senior manager from a sister team who was working from home country and moved abroad recently. Workwise, he was like a mentor to me. We met for dinner and he began to open up about his personal life.He confided that he had married young and might have made different choices if he were single now. He also mentioned that he had a brief fling after getting married and was open to the idea of having another short-term affair. He assured me that he would end things if he started developing deeper feelings for the other person.He was flirting with me and it was a clear indication that he wanted to cross professional/friendship boundaries with me. I have decided not to meet him outside office.I am extremely disappointed because:1. The professional relationship is butchered and I feel uncomfortable to be in his team in the future2. I was triggered because I have been cheated on, in the past.3.

Deloitte,eYDN07,Going through a difficult phase to leave vaping.,"I have been smoking and vaping for the past 4.5 years and it has become really bad lately. I am someone who seeks meaning in things and if I can't see a point in something, it's hard for me to work. When my girlfriend left me without giving a proper reason, it hit me hard and I started smoking. At one point, I was smoking around 10-12 cigarettes a day. During this time, I moved to the US and felt out of place. However, I completed my Masters and got a job in one of the FAANG companies after graduating. Then, a friend introduced me to vaping and I switched to it from cigarettes. I have been continuously vaping for 2 years now and I feel like it has taken over me. I cannot remember a single day in the last 4.5 years when I didn't smoke or vape. I want to change but sometimes I feel alone in this world. As people grow older, they become more time and people sensitive. I feel that whoever talks to me, talks because they want me to do something for them or I can be of some use to them. I don't see people with pure intentions anymore. I had some really strong issues with my roommates in the past and all of this kept me hooked onto smoking just to stay away from thoughts that something must be wrong with me.This morning, I woke up and suddenly collapsed in bed for a few seconds. I feel like I am getting used to feeling like this, which is not my intention. If anyone is reading this, please never even think of getting a vape. It occupies your mind like nothing else can.Tc:160k#smoking #vaping #mentalhealth",,4/7/2023,19,337,5,Loneliness,Mental Health

She is now giving me 20% of her workload and I imagine I may get more from her boss (who’s the second most senior person on my team).Finally, Adam my boss has been traveling for work and took a week off before and after his trip. He had an assignment (among many others) for me to refresh some decks for him and make some changes. I had questions and spent 30 minutes with him on those. When the time came, I did those changes and shared it with his boss Amber. Amber wasn’t happy and asked me to make 3 different drafts.With all of his added work, I had a mental breakdown today and had to take the day off.

I feel a little defeated because despite working really hard under challenging circumstances, I’ve managed to snag a good paying job but it’s not enough. I’m a child of immigrants and I’ve never had any financial support after high school. I grew up with a single mother and instead I’ve had the burden of supporting her and my siblings throughout my college journey. I feel like I haven’t worked hard enough because I can’t afford to put my family in a home that I can call my own. I feel like I’ve done the best that I can but that’s not enough. I’m 26 now but when I look at my peers, they seem to be doing better off than I am (taking trips, just living life) and they’re making no where near what I am… but of course their family has set a foundation of generational wealth for them, and they probably never have to face some of the financial struggles that I have. It seems so unfair and honestly very discouraging with the way the US housing market is right now. I tell myself “just keep pushing forward” but I’m a little tired.

Verizon,pmthings,I give up,"After more than a decade of job instability, bouncing around over and over due to layoffs, closures, etc..., I am so burned out I can't even think anymore and want my life to be over. Yes, I'm seeing a therapist, and yes I am on like ALL of the drugs, but those don't help when I'm constantly terrified for my fucking job and how I will be able to take care of myself. I have had absolutely no support, guidance, or anything from the many managers I've had over the years, and today my current one told me to build a development plan out for the rest of the year by EOD. I don't even know what to write in there...nothing matters, I'll probably not even be here by the end of the year given my track record and I want to jump off a fucking bridge. I worked SO FUCKING HARD to pull myself out of the poverty I was in as a child, on my own, and with a disability. I put myself through college because it was the only way I'd get out of poverty, spent 20+ years paying it off...with no growth, no promotions, nothing. I've worn awards for my work and my managers tell me I'm ""meeting expectations"". I can't fucking stand this anymore. I'm so incredibly burned out, my nervous system is an absolute trainwreck and everyone has either abandoned me or never wanted me in the first place (see: my bio family, my soon-to-be ex-husband). I have taken breaks and tried talking to my manager, who deflects and blames me for my own failings despite me literally killing myself to show value. Nobody wants me anywhere, and I don't blame them, so it probably makes sense to erase myself from the equation entirely. I turn 50 years old this year and have nothing to show for it.

New,jvbwos,Should I move out temporarily?,"I (32M) am currently living at home with my mom, sister, and her son. I am mainly the care provider for my mom because she has disabilities and can’t work, so I am taking the responsibilities for going to docs offices and running errands for her. My sister is divorced and raising her kid, but she had a messy divorce and is still regularly harassed by her ex-husband over coparenting issues and random things. We split our mortgage but since I make substantially more than her, I pick up some of the bills and she barely gets any child support expenses because her ex is a douchebag and is low-income on top of that.Previously, I was living in a big city but moved back home during the pandemic. After being away from social scene for nearly 3 years, I have gotten older with fewer people and less opportunities to develop new relationships or maintain friendships. And dating is almost impossible because I am deep in the suburbs. I am thinking of moving to the city that is close to where my family is, so that way, I am not too far if needed (30-40min by car) and I can have some sanity back.I have been feeling really burnt out by responsibilities and generally not having a space of my own. I’m not talking about space as in my own room, but the space to just be me. I am a natural introvert and more private person, so being around family so much (especially with WFH) is a bit suffocating for me. I have some mental health issues (anxiety and borderline depression) that I want to address, but I don’t want to make this too known to my family - like I wouldn’t wanna do virtual therapy at home or go to therapist appointments only to come back to home immediately. (And likely, family will know because they’re always home as well).I have an opportunity to do a short term rent at a furnished condo for 6-7 months. This would allow me to recalibrate with myself and start redeveloping my own identity. This does mean that I would be spending extra $2500-3000 per month, but since it’s only for a short period of time, it might actually be beneficial to my mental health. I have been finding myself more irritable than before and I don’t like that side of me. I snap more easily at my family, which I hate doing. The alternative is to use the money to travel more frequently, but while I love traveling, I think what I need right now is a bit more of personal stability, peace, and serene space.My only fear and anxiety is that mom and sister have complex relationships (you know - mom and daughter stuff, and some childhood trauma we all suffered especially in immigrant families). So I feel uncomfortable leaving them. And I don’t want all the burden/responsibilities for day to day errands to solely fall on her. And since my sister is harassed by her ex every other week over email, I feel the need to be around. And I would like to stick around longer because I think my nephew needs a healthy male role model and provide some stability having one united family since his dad is a d-bag. Though I don’t think I’m able to be a really good male role model anyway lol.What do you think I should do?Edited & added poll.TC 200k",200000,4/20/2023,8,860,6,Family Issue,Anxiety

Here I go:I tried to control this addiction on my own for years and kept failing so I started seeing a sex therapist. My therapist told me they are seeing these issues more and more, so it's increasingly common. He has really helped, I haven’t watched porn in 1/2 year, I rarely masturbate and I feel like a million bucks!!I am single and dating around, and masturbation/porn were affecting my relationships with women as I was not able to perform well in bed because I had conditioned my brain to only get aroused with masturbation and porn. I am now rewiring my brain back to normal so I get aroused with the ""real thing"" as opposed to images on a screen (I know, sad...)There are several benefits that come when you stop masturbating and watching porn: better sex life, more energy, better focus (almost as if you're smarter, seriously) and great sense of social confidence (with women and also in any other social setting). All guys who stop (or diminish) watching porn and masturbating experience these effects, my therapist told me.In my experience the cravings to masturbate/watch porn diminish over time but it can be hard at first. It's just like any other addiction, it's your brain looking for that dopamine release it's used to and it takes time to rewire your brain. But it’s not impossible, I did it.Again, trying a sex therapist really helped, and knowing you will be held (softly) accountable on your next therapy session is one more layer of motivation to make the change.I am not making a moral or ethical statement here about porn or masturbation. I do not see either as bad or immoral. It's just that when it gets out of control it can have serious consequences on your life and needs to be addressed.I hope this helps others who might be going through the same situation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE to address some of the most common questions I’ve seen:- I am hesitant to list contact information for my therapist but you can find certified sex therapists here: https://www.aasect.org/referral-directory (that's where I found mine) And therapists do not necessarily need to be in your area as many do remote sessions.- I am not sure how many times it’s ok to masturbate. I tried to get this answer from my therapist and he said there isn’t a set number. Masturbating here and there is fine but if you are doing it so much that it's starting to have negative consequences in your life (along with porn) then there is a problem.- I cannot list all the actions I have taken to address this problem as it would make for a very long posting.

Octave,a x,Getting Lay off is messing with me,"I’m having so much difficulty coping with being lay off a few weeks ago with my recruiter job. It makes me more sad because since graduating in 2019 I’ve had nothing but an awful experience with job hunting. I graduated with a masters in public health back in 2019 and later found out it wasn’t a very entry level friendly role. I soon stumbled upon recruiting which was booming back 2021, but now it’s hit a dead end. Im just really hurt by this because I want so badly to buy a home, invest, pay of student loan debt, and go on vacation but the setbacks with jobs is making me so miserable. My mind is blank right now, I can’t even come up with solutions for my next role, I’ve been viciously applying to jobs since 2018 and having to get back out there again is just a nightmare that I’m reliving. My parents think I should go get a law degree but honestly I don’t have it in me to be in school for the next 3 years and to also rack up a six figure student loan debt. Im just so lost right now and have like no family or friends who’ve been through what I’m going through right now.

Meta,Skkkk84,Job insecurity is influencing my willingness to spend,"I perceive my job as being associated with a multitude of potential pitfalls. In order to maintain security, aside from the risk of layoffs, I'd have to overperform, something which I am not keen on doing. Consequently, I have become accustomed to viewing my paycheck as though it is not guaranteed. I feel like this for several years already, and it hurts.Despite earning the same salary as my colleagues who live in nicer apartments, I reside in a comparatively inferior area. I am hesitant to rent a place that I genuinely enjoy, as the possibility of losing my job at Meta would result in a significant portion of my paycheck being consumed by rent. In London, aside from fintech firms which may offer poor work-life balance, Meta provides one of the highest salaries.I find myself caught up in a loop that appears to be unsolvable.

I feel like whenever I describe my goals career and TC wise, my friends or peers from my uni just don’t get it. These guys think getting into FAANG or a big tech is totally out of their reach, and that making six figs in twenties is some crazy goal. It’s so sad to see, because these things are so achievable with some dedication and hard work which they’re not willing to put in and it makes me so mad, just bc YOURE not ambitious hard working and willing to chase ur dreams doesn’t mean you have to try and spread your mediocre mindset to others.The only person who believed in me was my ex, and my brother who saw me work so hard every day. I ended up getting a FAANG internship and achieving TC 130k there. Now recession hit and I’m back at non FAANG 81k tc full time. It’s ok though bc ik with some hard work and patience for economy to get better, I will get another offer at big tech hopefully.It just feels lonely though, my brother is busy with his fiancé, and I broke up with my ex. I feel like I’m surrounded by people who think working in Toronto is the pinnacle of their career while I just view it as a pit stop. So now whenever I talk about my goals they just dismiss it or say things like “oh only the 1% achieve that” well guess what I DID achieve that. I just have to do it again. The only time I felt I was around like minded people was my FAANG internship in Vancouver. And it doesn’t matter if someone is FAANG or not, even if they’re just trying to make it somewhere that’s good.Has anyone else felt this way and how can I cope / deal with being surrounded by non like minded ppl in a good way?

Capital One,Bee_7,Alcohol problem...,"Hi. Just venting. ):I'm 30, and I'm one of those called a ""functional alcoholic."" I have an unfortunately high tolerance (I can drink ~6-7 shots in less than 2 hrs and be somewhat drunk) as a small female. I've been drinking almost every single day in the past couple years, and before that I was still drinking 3-4 times a week.It's weird as whenever I need to not drink (prepping for exams while in school, have an important meeting next day, or on a nice trip (bc I don't want to waste it by being drunk)) I have no problem not drinking. Sometimes I'll just go straight sober for a month and be fine.I think drinking started as an easy coping mechanism, like many of you here I'm a first child of a poor immigrant fam that's also been a breadwinner since 16 (and doing everything administrative and also a ""counselor"" among the family members, iykyk).Now I just can't not drink after work. I get of work, come home, and just chug my drink and do chores and go to sleep at 10. It became such a strong habit. My health has been fine based on tests etc, though recently I noticed my hands are very lightly shaky from time to time.I got naltrexone so I take it at night then next day I know I can't drink - problem is I have a really bad side effect w it, I get a really bad brain fog. Bc I can't afford that while I work, I don't take it - then I drink, then I'm hung over next day where, I can do work but not at my fullest potential.I want to drink like a normal person where they drink on weekends w their friends etc, not someone that drinks for no fun reason just out of habit. I started making very small changes where I don't drink until certain time of the day after work or on weekends, changing my daily routine to break the pattern (or at least disturb it a bit).

She saw me do a couple of demos, gave feedback that was opposite of what my manager had given me for 2.5, an concluded I was doing a terrible job. None of what she asked was difficult it was just a different approach.Prior to transitioning to working with the VP, I was getting excellent feedback from peers and manager. But on the first 1:1 with the VP I was told I was significantly below expectations. She questioned my work ethic and how I was using my time. Expressed some thinly veiled remorse for hiring me, and has been micromanaging and criticizing me for a month now. When I tried to defend myself, she shut me down and wouldn't have it basically saying ""you should have known better."" I hear this VP badmouth other one of my colleagues regularly, and she's just pushy in general with people. I think I can do this job fine, but I just don't see ever changing the VPs view of me.

I don’t know how much longer I have to channel out when I’m interacting with them, almost all interactions are not at my energy level (when fundamental beliefs aren’t the same, the communication can be quite excruciating, it’s like you have to pretend to be someone else to cater to their toxic behavior/mentality). Boundaries work, but doesn’t mean i enjoy the interactions with them, for example, they can be quite racist and judgmental. Most time spending with them is them sharing gossips and talking shit about other people. I’m at the point thinking of going no contact, in a harmonious way (telling them I’ll be going on a self discovery trip for five years), and just vanish. Is this all that bad?

She didn't discuss this before marriage with me about this.Seeing my dreams getting shattered every night of my life is so so frustrating. I can't bear this anger or frustration or depression or whatever and this is showing off in my work.

Spotify,fyldfy24h,I am confused and worried,"Had a relationship with a girl. Perfect relationship, love her, emotionally in touched with her. We were together 10 years. But I was also sexually attracted by men. I broker up with her during covid. I met a guy, nice guy, love him, have a relationship with him. Still keep thinking my ex girlfriend though and how we were perfectly matching. I realised that I am sexually attracted by both, men and women. I feel more sexual attracted by men, but feel more connected with women which for me is much more important than having sex. I am feeling lonely even if I have a relationship. But I shouldn’t feel lonely. I feel that I cannot speak with anyone about that. I am ashamed about being attracted to men. I spoke to my parents about that but are not fully supported. They pretend that I never said anything and that the guy does not exist in my life. After 1.5 years with the guy I am still thinking my ex girlfriend. I dont have communication with her. I am still dreaming and thinking of her but I am not sure whether is because I feel ashamed about me and being with a guy, or because my parents do not accept it, or because of the society or even because I am with a guy who does not perfectly march with me. Or maybe I have her in my mind because I actually want to be with her. But why during my relationship with her I was thinking having also sex with other men. Am I gay/ bi? Don’t understand. I also hate knowing how gays, on average, live. I know not everyone is the same. I hate gay radar, hate gay apps, hate being so easy for people to have sex without knowing each other. I know again not everyone is the same but I just dont like all of these. I am feeling more insecure being with a guy rather with a girl. I know again is not about gender. But it is what I feel. I kind try speak with therapist. I changed 3 therapists. Can’t see that I can get help from that. I feel I am paying my money for nothing.",,3/1/2023,34,1256,9,Family Issue,Others

I dont know what to change first since it all seems not right.Microsoft is a great employer but i am super bored in my job (i work as a sales specialist) and my clients and coworkers are all middle aged men -no offence.- but I just have nothing with them in common. I am a female, single, 32. The only thing holding me there is the good salary and I am trying to save as much as I can to hopefully never have to work in a corporate job (esp full time). I also stopped going to the office because I am not inspired by the people. I prefer wfh but that often is isolating and somehow I notice it is bad for my mental and emotional health to be this much alone. I was kind of hoping to be part of those layoffs at MS atm.I am also super bored with my social life since my good friends all had a family. I guess the winter now doesnt make it better. I am not super close to my family since they are rather toxic. I have been single for 3 years since my last relationship took a long time to recover from. Been meeting lots of men but just not feeling it but would love to be in a relationship that is great again. Feels a bit like I am wasting ""my youth"" with my single being for this long.I am just feeling like I am wasting my days, weeks and months without purpose. I know I need a big change but not sure how to approach it. Make a big cut and move to a new country? Resign and take some time off?

CarGurus,blitflit,This could be why Meta thinks they're toast,"This NYT article talks about the spike in teen depression. The writer initially blamed teen depression on Trump, then realized the spike in depression rate coincided not with Trump (2016) nor COVID (2020) but with social media going really big. 2012 was when Facebook bought Instagram and ""selfie"" became a real word. And 2012 is when teen mental health went into the toilet. Some interesting observations by social scientists are cited in the article.It looks like blaming teen mental health problems on social media might become a bipartisan thing. Social media use might become age restricted. No wonder Meta is dumping their employees.Many of you posting about depression and anxiety on Blind might have been one of those social media teens in 2012. Maybe we should be dumping social media too, for our own health.

I also decided that I don't want to pursue a career in academia.I got interested into PM kind of work (mainly because I hated how Google forcefully pigeonholed me into a SRE role and didn't allow me to learn or do anything else, always stating ""we don't care about your skills and interests, you don't have the correct job role for this task"").But there is zero PM headcount at Google and PM job postings at other companies in Germany require me to have a business degree, not the CS degree that I have.I tried starting my own (non-tech) company, found plenty of interested customers, but got hindered by not having the required certificates of craftmanship to build wooden cat toys (my plan was to also use my coding skills to build some really awesome stuff). Yes, in Germany you need a multi-year degree for even that. Plus to get the required certificate you can only get a low paid apprenticeship position in a far far away city with 100% mandatory presence.

Snap,trtlesnap,"From burned out, PIPd, imposter… to happy, fulfilled, L6 :)","I just turned 30, and I was reflecting on how much things have changed for me in the last 2 years. There are lots of highs and lows in this crazy stupid world we're in.If you're stuck in a ""low"", read on.2 years ago I was burned out, single, overweight, and feeling like a huge imposter. And pre-COVID not many people talked about this stuff, so I felt super isolated. Then.... I got PIPd and COVID happened and I was unemployed for a few months and felt like a complete ✨ failure ✨.That period of my life was definitely rock bottom. Fortunately, I got through it, with a lot of effort + professional help from a therapist, exec coach, and PT.Since not everyone has the time, money, or knowledge to effectively navigate a personal/professional ""transformation,"" here are some of the best insights and (free) resources that helped me get where I am now:1. [LIFE] Be patient: most people (myself included) want immediate results, rewards, satisfaction. You are literally capable of achieving virtually any goal on a 1-2 year horizon. Play the long game. Do today what the ""you"" two years from now would want you to do.2. [LIFE] Start small: habits are the key to behavior change that produces lasting results. Stick to the 2-minute rule: force yourself to start a habit with just 2-minutes a day, every day. Even if it feels useless - just do it. Trust me.3. [LIFE] Points #1 and #2 are my biggest takeaway from reading dozens of books. Don't fall in a ""self-help"" book spiral. It's a whole ass industry. It's mostly well-intentioned, but it can be easy to read too much and not DO enough. Don't let these resources become another thing you procrastinate. Here's a good resource with the key ideas summarized: https://shorturl.at/brCQV4. [BODY] Physical wellness is foundational to all wellness. Focus on sleep. Go to the gym. Don't know what to do, or where to start? Pick 1 workout per day from here: https://musclewiki.com/5. [MIND] Understand your mind and its weaknesses. You aren't special, we all fall victim to universal ""thinking traps."" Identify cognitive distortions and recognize how they can influence your thoughts, beliefs, and actions: https://ddlamm.itch.io/thinking-errors6. [MIND] ""You feel like shit. An interactive self-care guide"": https://youfeellikeshit.com/7. [MIND] Start a reflection / journaling habit today.

CDPH,TskW62,Nothing changed after taking FMLA,"I'm a Data Analyst contractor for the CDPH with an abusive supervisor. I took leave because of panic attacks and severe depression by my manager's micromanagement and retaliation - taking work away, undermining me, and having meetings related to my workflow and changing data protocols without my knowledge. Then, problems came up with my workflows because they left me in the dark, and I had to take the blame.I stupidly reported them to my staffing agency's HR, and they did nothing but chastised me and insinuated I'm making stuff up even with proof. They took my manager's word on everything and didn't seem to understand the severity of the situation from my perspective.Fast forward, I took FMLA and gave myself a few days to mentally recover before applying for jobs and working on side projects. I had interviews and almost made it to the second to last and final rounds for most of them. They rejected me due to hiring freezes from layoffs and lack of experience, but I kept applying and stayed connected with the recruiters.Sadly, I had to return back to work early because my disability money got tight. My manager blocked me from accessing tools I need, intentionally gave me vague work and instructions, and removed me from team meetings and chats. My contract ends in a few weeks, which most likely wasn't renewed for the reasons above, and I don't have another job lined up yet.I left some details out because of privacy reasons.

Though around half a year later, we got another new hire and he is definitely a superstar. He is the same age as me (graduated the same year) but is extremely fast, charming and bright. He was able to pick up and finish the biggest and most technically challenging task that would usually take me twice as long to complete.

I keep hearing about this anti-intellectualism trend also, it seems they’re playing a big part in it. Deciding to overlook the rights they fought hard for and play it off as if it’s no big deal to go back to just being arm candy.I’m never going to condemn SAHMs, or the provider/nurturer, gender contract that our society traditionalized. I do think though it’s equally commendable if men played the nurturing role too while mothers take a stab at the provider role. Unfortunately it never pans out that way in reality. A lot of men weaponize their incompetence when we know they’re more than capable of taking care of children and doing household chores.My main observation is that there are a lot of women glorifying the idea of being a stay at home wife (WITHOUT CHILDREN). And it’s kind of silly because if you’re locked into a relationship like that, usually children hold together relationships like that. I know you can of course mutually agree to not have children. But if you’re with a guy for the sole purpose of being a trophy (object), it is probably inevitable that you’ll be replaced, abused, and or disrespected (don’t approve either).It doesn’t affect me either way, but I think I will raise my daughter the same way I raise my sons. I think the main problem people overlook when they treat women unfairly is that each one of us have a half chance of being born a girl. And they are NOT living life on easy mode. The easy mode you refer to is exactly what you criticize and try to embarrass them for.

Addepar,me_useless,Breakup. For the best but I feel lost. Need advice,"Honestly don’t know why I’m posting this on blind.Dated a girl for 2 years mostly LDR (NY/MD) and slowly but surely realized that we could never align on values regarding future vision, money, etc…I really loved her but we were not able to understand each other’s values. I’m pretty indoctrinated into that Asian standard in that I envision a double income marriage with kids, living a better life than my immigrant parents etc… Her vision is conservative in another way in that the guy should take care of most/all expenses of the girl and traveling the world was a priority over raising/giving kids a privileged life.I think the breakup is good for both of us long term but it’s so gut wrenching because in spite of the differences (which we tried to work out to no avail) I really love and care about her. Moreover, she has no family in the states and there is also a dimension where I feel as if I’m abandoning her.In the end, from my side I felt poorly treated because I never met her expectations of a boyfriend. I was long distance, which I think was the ultimate problem. And I feel like sometimes as if I was faulted for not leaving my job in NYC or transitioning to full time remote to move to her area where she works at a restaurant full time. (This was a major contention point because I felt like in her vision, if I was the “bread winner” why I’d have to forsake my career). She actually has a computer science degree but never made serious attempts at getting a job, which I never understood either but also never wanted to heavily pressure her into doing as it seemed like she had a community working at the restaurant.Another side note is that although this should not matter, my mother did not like her for that specific reason - working a blue collar job. I’d like to say this had no impact but I think it was always in the back of my mind that my mother wasn’t accepting.Even when I tried to make her happy by doing things outside of my comfort zone (ordering her food regularly as an example), I felt like it was treated as status quo. Distance in the end seemed like the ultimate problem. Her rationale for not moving to me was she was against leaving her life in MD to come to a brand new city.Now that it’s over, I’m lost. I have a few close friends who are all guys I usually just play video games with. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to find someone who loves me for me. I’m not that huge of a party goer and tbh I don’t have much “game” and I feel like dating in NYC needs it.Was in a relationship for 3 years prior to this one (throughout college and early covid) and the gap between last one and this one was a decent amount of quarantine time/early career focus.I’m 26 now and feel just burnt out by my last two long term relationships. The last time I remember being someone who actively seeks women/relationships around me was when I was 19. When I was 23-24 was way more concerned about career stuff and met my last girlfriend by happenstance.I think I’m a pretty good catch other than the fact I don’t have many very social friends - mostly hangout via video games since covid. My hobbies are exercising and video games (experimenting to get into some content creation and building apps on the side)I’m exhausted and don’t want to get into another relationship right away. But also feels like next attempt will be my last to fit that standard I mentioned earlier.What should I do? Any therapeutic advice? I’m lost, lonely, burnt out, and feel like I still love her even though I know we’re not good for each other.TC - 220k",,3/27/2023,14,917,6,Family Issue,Others

She works 6.5h a day in addition to raising him, I totally get why she’s too tired to socialise as often these days.I sometimes make friends with new people and then have to write them off as close friends, for having kids and reducing our communication to just texts.I wish there was an app to finding and socialising with other childfree people.

New,mnJkph,Coparenting with a narcissist and gaslighter: how to protect my child?,"Recently divorced a narcissistic husband, but he has started a parental alienation towards me from our son. Tonight, My 4-year old son started crying tonight and said that he feels guilty and sad that his dad is lonely and sad because he is with me at my place. And he started saying he doesn’t like grandma (my mother) out of nowhere. My mom and son have really strong bond (we live together), and even after saying all that, he went to play with her as usual. I suspect there’s some gaslighting or emotional control by the coparent going on.I am not sure what to do about this situation. The Junior also said that his best friends are daddy and Uncle James (his dad’s brother), but he only met him once when he was like 8 months old. And then he added that grandma is not his friend anymore. He said something like “Daddy said grandma isn’t my friend but Uncle James is my friend.”Then he started crying more and said he is confused, and that he thinks he’s the reason why daddy is sad and lonely.All this sounds really dangerous and I’m afraid that our child is being guilt-tripped at a very young age, and possibly headed to severe mental illness down the road. It’s a delicate situation because his father antagonizes every time I attempt to have a conversation about our child’s well-being or medical/school-related matters. I read that once the parental alienation has begun, it only gets worse and becomes irreversible. I know I am legally required to let the child’s father know if I pursue a child therapist for our son, but I don’t think he’s a safe person to involve in the process given what I have heard from our son.Blind Tax: 150k",,3/1/2023,25,952,11,Family Issue,Sad

Rippling,d72nsO,Disheartened by how out-of-reach truths and knowledge are from me,"TLDR: I don’t get math and I’m madI feel significantly limited either by my intelligence or my inability to become more intelligent. Taking concrete examples, I can’t wrap my head around various (basic) things in number theory, lambda calculus(specifically), group theory, meta mathematics, and philosophy. Something more specific just for the day, I haven’t been able to “get” Y combinator time and time again when I tried through the years.I know that “something is making a lot of sense over there, out of reach, to a lot of people, smart people”, and I firmly believe it is the case, because of the way they present it and try to teach me, and because of the fact occasionally I feel I do understand some of the easier stuff and am on “the inside” with them on those fronts.But most of the time, I just cannot get it. As an atheist, I think I now understand what some faithful people (mostly of Zen, not sure about Christianity) call an enlightenment and the fact they perfectly know they don’t have it and how they are understandably mad and anxious and confused as I am, them with Tao and me with truths in Math.I do champion the duck theory - and feel I am so incapacitated to quack, walk, and swim like a duck (in this case an intelligent human) and inferior to even GPT (let alone any upcoming true AGIs) when it explains the concepts I just can’t get so clearly. I heard about enough arguments that how it’s not conscious, but it doesn’t matter to me because I literally can’t *play* or *mimic* a duck (read an intelligent / enlightened human) as well as a GPT can. According to the duck theory, which I believe in, that’s all that matters. I’m not transcendentally idealistic or “self centered” like Kant, so I don’t think I’m that advanced or special.Btw, I’m not staked in any of these in real life, but that makes it especially bizarre when I think about my frustrations in this my philosophical existential seizure. Also forgive me if I sound naive, as I didn’t get a philosophy or math degree, which if I did, honestly, I wouldn’t be here writing this.",,4/6/2023,9,479,6,Loneliness,Anxiety

I go through the motions every day, every week I’m waiting for the weekend when I get to hang out with my friends or go do something fun, but I don’t think anything we do in this lifetime is going to matter in the long run and I believe the meaning of life is just to enjoy the ride. I don’t want to waste my time on stupid chores that take a long time to do for very little return, I only want to do the important things that keep the lights on so that I can spend the rest of my time enjoying life.My wife is completely different, she’s constantly worrying about what ifs and what can go wrong, and she needs us to pick the absolute best option for every single decision, even if it means spending a few more hours to save a few more dollars. She maintains a google doc (currently 25 pages) of stuff that she wants me to do or something she wants to discuss, with notes - most of which are stuff that has been there for months or years but haven’t gotten done, and yet we’re fine, which means those things don’t matter or don’t need to be done.Every single day when we talk she will ask me what I’ve done that day and ask me when I’ll get around to doing stuff. She doesn’t ask how I’m feeling or care about anything else. This is rich coming from her because she doesn’t even work (never kept a job for more than 3 months, total yoe is less than 2 years even though we graduated more than 10 years ago). We don’t have any kids that she’s taking care of, and we are currently in different countries so she’s not taking care of me either. Even when we lived together I was the one taking care of her - I do the cooking and we split the cleaning, despite me being the sole breadwinner. She doesn’t even drive and I need to drive her if she wants to go anywhere. And because she doesn’t cook or drive, I also do the grocery shopping and outside errands.

I have gently reminded her that her reports need to be given work and trust them otherwise they will never get upto speed. Right now, she has skipped breakfast and lunch and is hunched in front of the laptop. It’s very unhealthy and she already has multiple vitamin deficiencies from the annual physical I forced her to go to. I think I should have some sort of intervention. It’s very unhealthy and I am afraid about her having some mental breakdown.Whenever I ask her to switch jobs she says the job market is bad and it’s better to be safe for now. I got her a season pass for skiing as she seemed interested and also installed a cargo carrier in our car.

And I dont want to look backward and start taking the medication.Medication worked great for me and I never abused it in any way but for my personal level, I felt like I am abusing my nervous/cardiovascular health system with the chemicals to be able to “focus” and “deliver” good results for some of the things that I already was good at.And as I had been on them for a few years and stopped them for last 6 months, I have developed a anxious habit of being terrified and thinking I might not be able to be achieve the results in work all the time and that sometimes drains my energy.In some ways, it is true as my performance in comparison to any other folks in the team is very bad from my perspective.

Intuit,plJL74,Ever wonder why on earth you married your spouse?,"TLDR: my wife threw a tantrum over a mild annoyance in a public place. Anybody ever had to deal w a spouse like this and wonder if it’s time to break up?Edit: We’ve been married 5 years, no kids, and she suffers from EDS(chronic connective tissue disorder) and recently diagnosed w Chiari malformation possibly leading to surgery if we decide it’s best path.——I set up an appointment at Cleveland Clinic for my wife 4-5 months ago. She finally had the appointment yesterday. We drove 3 hours the night before the appointment and stayed at the Intercontinental hotel attached to the hospital to make the day’s logistics as easy as possible.When we checked out my wife left her Theracane in the room by accident. She realized this while we were waiting to see the doctor and asked me to call the front desk to have housekeeping set it aside.The doctor appointment goes pretty well, no revelations but doctors were great and said they’d put us in touch w a specialist.When we get back to hotel to pick up our bags, my wife asks front desk about the Theracane and they said housekeeping didn’t find anything but they’d be able to ship it to us if it turns up. Mildly annoying but this isn’t a family heirloom it’s a 30-40 thing you can buy on Amazon and have delivered the next day.My wife is pissed and starts raising her voice. I try and reason with her calmly but she ignores me. Hotel staffers are being kind of annoying but then my wife is being super rude so I give them benefit of the doubt. My wife then says she’s going to go check the room herself. Staff says no you can’t do that it’s occupied, but she walks to the elevators and goes up. Staff starts calling security which leads to the police eventually showing up. Throughout my wife is raising her voice and not making any attempt to be or even appear calm.Somehow she convinces a staffer to go into the room and they find the Theracane under the bed. She comes downstairs and is still acting like a jerk being loud and making a scene. It’s not the Ritz, but Intercontinental is a pretty nice hotel. There are medical professionals and people I could easily imagine being doctors in the lobby. I apologized to the staff.We get in the car and my wife is yelling at me about something stupid about her suitcase and she’s slamming the door repeatedly. The police officer is driving behind us in a way that feels we’re escorted off the property like let’s make sure she goes away for good.So, title, has anybody had days like this where their spouse is acting like a total lunatic and you’re asking yourself why oh why did I marry this person?We’re seeing a couples therapist and I’m also seeing a therapist one on one at the request of my wife because she says I’ve created all these problems for us. I’ve had my doubts about that but I’m gone along w therapy to see if there’s anything I’m doing that’s inappropriate.But now I’m thinking wow after that display at Intercontinental I have confirmation that my wife is a total hothead even to other strangers and that it’s very likely that I’m correct in my belief that she creates most of the fights in our relationship.Anyways just wondering if anyone has dealt with a spouse like this or similar and you just wonder wtf was I smoking marrying this person?Appreciate you all.TC 205k lcol 5 yoe#depression #mentalhealth #burnout #marriage #relationships",205000,12/8/2022,104,4770,28,Family Issue,Burnout

At least mine are, they throw soft threats to force the husband to divorce his wife, verbal harassment and are very judgemental of anything and everything I do!- Why do some* husbands fail to listen to their wives? Even when it gets to a point where the wife starts to feel stressed, disappointed and invalidated.- Asked my husband to send both families back to India, but he does not agree cause he feels what will the relatives and others think of his parent's early departure. I explained it is affecting our relationship he choose to ignore it, what should I do?- Is this relationship even worth pursuing?Background:My husband and I invited our families over for our wedding in the states. Coming from an Indian family, the expense for the wedding rituals should be covered by the girl's family. Being an independent woman I did not want my family to take that burden so I arranged a small wedding with close friends and family and took the full expense without my husband's support either.The first month of his family visit flew by quickly with wedding activities and other things. From the day after the wedding, my MIL pushed my husband to 'control' me. One day she sat down my husband and riled him up for not helping with cooking, and cleaning, etc., My husband started to show signs of disrespect, illtreating, abandoning, etc., At first, I did not know the reason at all, but one day I confronted him that this is not the right behavior and not a sign of positive relationship. He mentioned the issues his mom brought up to his attention IMO they're very trivial (For example, I did not hand over glass water to my father-in-law when he was sitting at the dinner table when he did not even ask me for it) When I shared my opinion she was furious and passed several bad statements and curses. In a different fight, my husband and in-laws humiliated my dad and mom for not bearing the wedding expenses, they keep holding them accountable for this. These are just some of the many issues that I am facing in my household.I made a trip to Austin recently, once in a while I like to check the hallway camera to get a peak of my dogs. One of those days I saw & heard my MIL, FIL and BIL brainwashing my husband to control me. I recorded that and confronted my husband he accused me of spying in my own house, played the victim card, and praised his mother!I have started recording most of the fights and the verbal harassment, but I haven't taken any action yet. I don't know how to approach this situation on the other hand he constantly gives me threats of divorce, asking me to go out of the house ( I want to get out of the house but my mom & dad do not like me to give up), telling me that if it was some other guy in this situation they would probably hit me for my actions, and that I should be extremely happy for my life RN.Can someone advise me what is the best way to go forward in such situations?

Occasionally they make mistakes and it may come with a price, you have to pay.This is why, my friends, do not mix work with family. Do not take your work home, cast your family aside and forget about giving time to your children.

Had an even better time, absolutely loved my life, experienced everything but again hated or was never interested in what was taught in classes. Got the degree. Yayy. Apply for an internship (best way to get a job is to get an internship). I did. Got it. Dont ask me how(I just prepared a sheet of interview questions and had a 45 min interview in which maybe I botched half of the answers but still ended up getting the internship)Luckiest guy on earth right? I certainly felt like that.Struggled through internship but somehow got converted to full time. Again a Yayy life changing moment.Struggled through work, somehow was able to fake my way to one promotion to another promotion in due time. Even did couple of job switches for big TC jumps ( all that was also 99% luck and 1% cramin through interview materials)Throughout all this time I never questioned it but just kept at it. Kept faking it and faking it.Until no more. I can’t do this anymore. Every day now is a struggle. The realization that what I am doing with my life by working a job which I don’t like is killing me. YOLO is hitting me hard and i cant get old just regretting.PS No one close to me is able to understand what I am feeling or going through or is supporting me.Just reaching out to my blind community for support.TC 300k",300000,1/17/2023,43,1682,27,Indians Issue,Others

Then I moved teams at Amazon because my team was toxic but stayed in that role only for 3 months and then I got 2 offers post that. One was at Snowflake and one was at DD. I got everything I wanted from snowflake after negotiations but chased DD who was just not responding.

I was working a job that paid me just enough to cover expenses and set aside a bit to travel back home and such. That evening that guy came in and didn't buy his coffee. I noticed because I used to have my dinner brought from home at the same time. He looked fidgety, likely very hungry but sat patiently at his corner table. I could not eat my dinner that day. I decided to buy this guy a coffee and a meal combo but didn't want him to feel like he was being pitied. I paid for the order and added 'change' of 20$ to be returned to him, keeping myself anonymous. 10 minutes later the food arrived at his table and I witnessed something I still cannot shake off. He started sobbing, at first refusing the food and then just crying. He sat numb for a good 10 minutes before he touched the food. I suddenly realized how small my issues were. I grew up poor but we never were short of food. This was my first experience witnessing hunger like this. The kicker was when he left, he dropped some coins in the tip jar. A week later I heard from my recruiter that I got the job I interviewed for that week. That night I went to the cafe and gave the lady behind the register a gift card to the dollar general nearby to give to him. It killed me that I was negotiating with a recruiter for RSUs when this guy here literally did not know if he had enough pennies to get dinner. I wanted him to have a new beginning just the way I was. He was somehow a part of my journey by now.Why am I sharing this here? Every time I pass my old neighborhood I think of hunger, I think of being content and I think of being grateful. If you have a meal on your table, a roof over your head and means to be in good health, count your blessings because you are just so so darn lucky.[Edit2: Thank you for the kind messages. I am glad my experience has touched so many of you. To those who say that the guy should be responsible for his destiny and face the consequences of his past actions, my only response is, you may be right but I cannot bring myself to watch someone go hungry.][Edit: I had no idea people would appreciate this so much ♥️🙂 I was expecting people trolling/mocking me for polluting Blind with a sappy post. I often think of that guy and really hope he is in a good place now. No one deserves to sleep hungry. ]",,9/6/2021,567,46100,4021,Others,Others

New,empath0,"Anger, Burnout and Hopeless","Corporate politics can be an exhausting and disheartening aspect of the professional world. When one finds themselves entangled in a web of power plays, favoritism, and manipulation, it is not uncommon to experience feelings of anger, burnout, and hopelessness.Anger is a natural response to the injustices and unfairness that often accompany corporate politics. Witnessing colleagues advancing not based on merit but through cunning tactics or connections can be infuriating. It's frustrating to see hard work and dedication overshadowed by office politics, where personal agendas often take precedence over the greater good of the organization. This sense of anger can be overwhelming and lead to a constant state of discontentment.Furthermore, the ceaseless engagement in corporate politics can lead to burnout. Navigating a treacherous environment where alliances shift constantly, and trust is a rare commodity takes an immense toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. The constant need to be on guard, watching one's back, and carefully choosing words and actions can be exhausting. The perpetual state of high alertness and the feeling of being trapped in a toxic cycle gradually erodes one's enthusiasm, passion, and energy. Burnout sets in, leaving individuals feeling emotionally drained, physically exhausted, and devoid of motivation.As time passes, a profound sense of hopelessness can take hold. It becomes increasingly apparent that merit and hard work are not always rewarded, and those who excel at playing political games are the ones who succeed. The system can seem rigged, and the belief in fairness and justice can wane. The feeling of hopelessness can make it challenging to muster the motivation to continue striving for excellence or to make a positive impact within the organization. A sense of disillusionment settles in, making it difficult to see a way forward or envision a different, more equitable reality.When faced with the turmoil of corporate politics, it is essential to find healthy ways to cope. Seeking support from trusted colleagues, mentors, or friends who can offer guidance and perspective can be invaluable. It's crucial to focus on maintaining personal integrity and values, even in the face of adversity. Exploring avenues for personal growth and development outside of the political landscape, such as acquiring new skills or pursuing passions, can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.Ultimately, it may be necessary to reassess one's situation and consider alternative paths. If the toxic nature of corporate politics becomes unbearable, exploring opportunities in other organizations or industries that align more closely with personal values and principles may be a viable option.Remember, although corporate politics can be demoralizing, there are still pockets of integrity, collaboration, and meaningful work within many organizations. By preserving your own authenticity and seeking out positive relationships, you can navigate the treacherous waters while maintaining your sanity and professional integrity.",,5/18/2023,2,199,1,Family Issue,Burnout

Oracle,oImG17,15yr old severe anxiety issue at exam time,"Folks, I need a bit of input. My 15 year old daughter gets very anxious when it is exam time and especially for some subjects that she thinks are difficult, Chem for example. She has a good tutor to help but it does not seem to help. In extreme cases she cries and shivers with anxiety the night before and does not know how to deal with it.Reason for her anxiety is she wants to do well on the exam but thinks she is under prepared. So she stresses out and does not sleep overnight and next day does not do well because of lack of sleep. I tried many ways to convey to her that it is ok to not do well on the exam and that is not the end of the world but that does not seem to work.I want to offer her professional help, but I am worried that if it backfires and she starts thinking that she has psychological issues that may create more problems such as losing confidence in herself etc.Appreciate any thoughts.

I keep dreaming about what I’ll do when I’m finally “financially free” which means something like $10M in “net worth”.

I’ve come up with more ideas than I care to think about because thinking about them fills me with angst for not having taken any action.With the rise of Ai late last year I thought this is finally it! My biggest issue has been laziness and chasing novelty (by the time I want to implement my ideas I’ve chewed it dry if any motivating energy) and now there are tools that make me so productive and allow me to move so fast that have such a high scaling capability that I must be on the verge of arriving! Nah. 5 months since 11/30 and I all I got are a shit ton of ChatGPT chat tabs and subscriptions to a dozen Ai “tools” and a YouTube/twitter FYP filled with “here’s how I used ChatGPT to make $10,0000 in 1 hour!”All the while I keep trying to remember that I got it really good! No debt, good chunk of savings, good family relationships, steady job and income, ability to easily travel and basically do whatever I want whenever I want - provided it’s in under a couple of weeks and doesn’t cost more than low 5 figures.If I’m being honest I don’t think I’ll find that “business” that will scale fast and make a few million in a couple of years at which point I’ll either do my job “for fun” and will therefore actually enjoy it or “find my passion”.

My mother does not want to take this to police because we have relatives, in laws everyone in the same city. She is worried about the society.- I love my parents. They are worlds best when they are with me only and not with each other. My father would cook for me everyday, takes me for a walk, watch movies, he took a loan on our house so that I can study in US, doing everything a father could do. Same goes with my mother. Thing go worse when they are with each other.- I am married now, cant discuss this with my wife. She can’t do anything about it and would tell everything to her side of family.- My mother is 58, father is 64. There is no way she could file for divorce.Any suggestions?",,11/5/2022,145,3581,13,Indians Issue,Trauma

Google,SundarSCI,Feeling discouraged by my dating life,"Before anyone asks, yes I’m Indian.My dating life has been pretty dry my entire life. I’ve never been in a serious relationship and only have ever had a couple of random flings when I was in a fraternity in college.I never had any flings in high school either. Fell down the pecking order due to a very skewed ratio, but likely also because I was not very popular (but not hated on since I got invited to every single party and was generally liked by others) or not rich enough.After a lot of introspection, I’ve concluded that there’s a few things I’ve been doing that haven’t been helping my case:1. Getting overweight starting in 2019 when I was job hunting as a new grad. I failed to stop the binge eating and inactivity stemming from my job hunt (on a visa).2. Falling into a major anxiety issue related to school and grades, which completely drained my confidence. I failed to control my mind and persevere through the hard times.3. Being whiny and complaining about how others have it easy in the dating scene. This means I was often very negative in nature without realizing it.4. Not being social enough and asking people to meet up, whether it’s to bars or even to play a sport.5. Being too nice about everything and to everyone, aka not having boundaries.6. Not fixing my cross bite fast enough, which is affecting the quality of my smile.Unlike the other posts on here, I take full responsibility for this situation. I recognize that Points #1 and #6 above don’t make me physically attractive. #2 and #3 don’t show enough maturity on my behalf. Without these, I can’t expect results, right?I was in the best shape of my life when I was part of my fraternity. My confidence improved significantly when I hooked up with 1 girl, and I wasn’t scared of making a move on anyone I found attractive. My confidence even got me my fraternity bid tbh.However, as of today, I have 0 confidence, still haven’t fixed my orthodontic issues because of delays, and am slowly climbing out of the bad mentality and bad eating habits. I feel like my entire youth is wasted now that I turned 25 yesterday and I can’t come down to terms with this. I often find it hard to sleep because of this, and am looking for a quick way out of this.I was thinking that maybe NYC might work since there’s a lot of Indian girls from the same city as me. The Bay hasn’t been too bad since I have been on 2 dates this month, but I guess this isn’t that impressive since most of my friends go on 2-3 every week.I’ve joined sports activities like tennis and soccer, but have not met any girls there.

I felt happy he’s laid off. I feel good for all the people left at the company that won’t have to interact with him anymore, since he had a lot of direct reports. I am also feeling angry the company didn’t fire him sooner to spare workers despite many complaints and concerns raised to HR and upper management. Several colleagues ended up depressed, burned out, and struggling for months after leaving the company. They are all now okay thankfully.I also feel bad because no one “deserves” a layoff.

Google,4477,Boss Triggers Abandonment Issues,"TLDR; How do I come to common ground and make peace with my manager? Our personalities are in conflict. I think we trigger each other emotionally because of our childhood traumas.I’m an anxious ISTJ, and she’s a fearful-avoidant INFP.Warning: Long post ahead about childhood trauma. Please be kind_____________________________I’ve been trying to empathize with my toxic boss so that I can tolerate her better. She’s passive-aggressive, retaliatory, stonewalls, has unprofessional emotional outbursts, yells, indecisive, incompetent, etc. I’ve been trying to stop hating her, so that I can have more grace / patience / tolerance in how I interact with her.Every toxic person is just a broken person inside with childhood trauma, right?She has previously described herself as “conflict-avoidant” and as an “INFP” and a “people-pleaser.” I’ve done a lot of research on this and I’ve concluded that she’s an INFP with a fearful-avoidant attachment style. People who fall into this category tend to often demonstrate borderline personality disorder symptoms.She and I are like oil and water. I am a blunt, direct, straightforward, assertive, confident, secure, confrontational, hyper-anxious ESTJ with abandonment issues who occasionally lacks tact and social awareness.She is an avoidant, indirect, passive-aggressive, insecure, emotionally sensitive INFP who lacks confidence, is resentful, fake, people-pleasing, and cares more about social cohesion and acceptance than anything. She tends to ignore emails because she doesn’t want to commit to anything in writing, and she refuses to make decisions. It really irritates me that she is indecisive and unclear.When she ignores me after I ask a direct questions, it really triggers my abandonment issue and sends me into an aggressive emotional spiral. I just follow up with her (each time, slightly more angry). My response to abandonment is usually anger. That’s a me-issue, and a function of my own childhood trauma (which I’m trying to work through in therapy). But given that my manager is someone who stonewalls and doesn’t respond to emails, my abandonment issues get triggered by her. I give her the benefit of the doubt when it’s just her being busy, but when it’s deliberate ignoring / stonewalling passive-aggression, I get extremely triggered.It sounds lame, but I’m just desperate for her approval. I just want to do a good job. But she’s a “toxic Asian tiger mom” type. In her eyes, I’ll never be good enough and I’m never doing enough. I’m desperate for her approval, but when she passively ignores me, I get so triggered and angry. I get livid and then make my situation with her worse by following up and being more direct. But putting pressure on a manager never makes them better.I talked to my therapist. And I realize that she triggers my childhood trauma. I grew up with a narcissist father who physically abused me and my mother. I always tried to please him and win his approval, and worked really hard to do it, but he lied to us, left and abandoned us. My abandonment issues are pretty serious. I get panic attacks from fear/anxiety when people take too long to respond by text.It irritates her every single time I follow up aggressively on my emails and press her for actual clarity and decision making. My hunch tells me that it’s because she doesn’t want to be accountable or on-the-hook in case her decision is wrong. This stems from her fearful-avoidance, insecurity and lack of confidence. My therapist tells me that I likely trigger her every single time I angrily press her for concrete clarity because it likely makes her feel inadequate and incompetent.Now, with the psychology of all this figured out — what next? I don’t think she’s an evil person. Just like I don’t think I’m an evil person. We’re all flawed, but I believe in the good in humans and in all people.Is there a way to fix this relationship? Any normal person would agree that I haven’t been properly managed. If you squint, you could also argue that I’ve been somewhat insubordinate or demanding or have lashed out at her. But I can’t fix her management style (or lack thereof). At this point, I just need her to stop hating and resenting me. I need her to respond to my emails (or I need to learn to accept that she never will, without being triggered). The personality conflict has gotten to the point where things at work are so tense that I took a mental health leave. But I’ll likely have to go back to working for her (if I don’t get laid off first) because of internal hiring freezes.How do I come to common ground and make peace with my manager? We trigger each other emotionally.Unrelated, but I also get triggered by co-workers who blatantly lie or are bad team players (Aka people who play dirty internal politics, lie about their workstreams, or quietly loop people out of projects to get more credit). I tend to react with anger, and I lash out by calling them out on their lies, correcting them loudly in large email threads, and being very direct in pointing out how they’ve lied. This always just shoots me in the foot, but more importantly: it triggers my manager because it goes against her “maintaining social cohesion” and people-pleasing instincts.How do I get better at handling corporate America? I’m a double Ivy who always got straight As in school, but I feel inadequate and incompetent in workplace settings. No one seems to care how smart you are, just how well you can socially align.TC: 250KPlease be kind, I’m very depressed by all of this. I know that I’m guilty and flawed in my own way.

New,myCabbage,Challenges with Finding Adequate Mental Health Care at Kaiser Hospital,"Hello everyone,I wanted to share my experiences with finding a mental health provider at Kaiser Hospital, and the challenges I've faced in this process.I have gone through 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists at Kaiser, and unfortunately, have not had much success in finding a provider who is a good fit for me. Specifically, I've had experiences with a disengaged psychologist who reads from a book and doesn't listen, and a psychiatrist who cancels our meetings regularly. These experiences have made it difficult for me to feel supported and get the help I need.In addition, I've requested exceptions on several occasions to see a non-Kaiser doctor, but unfortunately, these requests have been declined. This has been especially frustrating for me, as I feel that my mental health has gotten worse since being under the care of Kaiser providers.I'm wondering if anyone else is facing similar challenges with finding a mental health provider at Kaiser Hospital? It would be helpful to hear other people's experiences and insights, and to know that I'm not alone in this process.Overall, I hope that we can continue to advocate for ourselves and push for the best possible care for our mental health needs.

Argonne National Laboratory,pRBE42,Strained relation with spouse,"This is a vent post and need some inputs from you all.I’m from India (now US citizen), have two kids and a spouse. My marriage and relationship with my wife have been through rough patches. This is arranged marriage and there have been differences between families even before the wedding.I and my wife had a good time and I understand differences do come up between the couple. It was always me that has to compromise and put all my effort to make the relationship work. She is career-oriented and I know that since the beginning and have huge respect for her. Beyond a certain point, it is stretching over the limit. She has issues with her team wherever she works, always. With a myopic scope, she always complains that the team does not like her and gives her stress at the workplace on purpose. It's the same thing no matter wherever she works, she changed 4 employers in 3 years. She never ends up complaining to me every day. The only conversations we have daily are about the issues at her workplace and with her family.With kids around, I have to take care of them every single thing, waking up, getting ready for daycare, breakfast, dinner, feeding them, taking them to parks, etc. She cooks daily though whenever she can; if kids are hungry when she is working, she doesn’t even care. When the kid is crying in her office room, I figure out only then that he is hungry and I need to feed him. Almost every weekday, I have to take care of the kids along with working, household work, and regular stuff. She does not care what they do at daycare, or how they spend their day, not interested in kids' activities. For this reason, both kids are always with me and cry if I am not around them. I also work full-time remotely, so it gets too much work managing both andworking and I lose my temper once in a while. But I am fine taking care of kids as both partners have equal responsibility towards them.She has issues with her family back home. For some reason, she and her family are always arguing and fighting over one thing or the other. It seems that without any argument they don’t enjoy their conversation. She spends her time from when she wakes up till office work starts, fighting with her parents and siblings, and repeats the same after dinner till late at night. When I tell her why she is doing that, she gets pissed off at me and says its none of my business and I should not involve with her family issues. Fair enough. But with the entire drama of constant fighting over the phone is scaring my kids and is having a negative impact on them.She has issues with my family and siblings too. She never had good relations with my family and I accepted that lately, though there is no reason for that. She has no friends, literally zero friends, her family has no family friends, and relatives have deserted the family, though they talk once in a while over the phone. Recently she went on vacation to her family with kids. I asked to take the kids to my home, in the same city, a 30-minute drive from her place, so they can see their grandparents (my parents). She spent 30 days with her family but has all kinds of excuses not to take the kids to my place. I asked to just take them for an hour or two, she has all the time to go around the city with her parents in the entire month, but cannot spare a few hours to take the kids to my place. My parents are aged and have a hard time stepping out. They only go out for hospital visits. I don’t force her to visit my parents, she may have issues, but what right she has to cut off ties between grandparents and grandchildren?I know this relationship is not working, we don’t find interest in each other. For me, work, family, and kids are important equally. She is bothered only about work, career, salary, and money. Me, My kids are all secondary. She does not seem to show any interest in family life, at least for kids sake, no. I asked her many times to join me for couples counseling, but, she denies that she has a need to attend counseling, as she is always right and finds fault with me. She in fact has the attitude to find faults with everyone else except her. She is the most perfect person in this world. If anyone says a word saying she may be wrong on something, she is pissed off and picks up arguing with that person. Always complaining about something or the other, but never taking a single step to solve any issue. Complaining and fault-finding with others are what keep her ego satisfied. I had a few therapy sessions a few years back. I am told she may be exhibiting signs of borderline personality or narcissistic disorder, but without her attending any sessions, they cannot conclude that.After so many years of suffering alone, and still doing good at work and making sure kids are doing well, I think now it is the time to get out of this mental stress and agony. I am taking the daring step to separate legally, knowing that it will be extremely hard for me financially and for the kids. Talking to family lawyers soon to take appropriate action and get out of this vicious relationship as soon as possible.If anyone has gone through a similar experience, please let me know how did you navigate this.TC: 110K (yoe 8)",110000,12/18/2022,53,1861,24,Indians Issue,Stress

They expect me to do house chores, take care of them, take care of the baby all alone and want my husband to chill out.They don’t like when I step out of the house. But they have no issues if my husband goes out for having fun. I barely get to sleep.A recent outburst tore me apart mainly because my husband kept quite. He blamed me for trying to prove myself in the argument. I kept crying and he didn’t care.I have been working really hard to make them happy and doing things that they like. But looks like it’s not enough.Now I have lost interest. I don’t feel like talking to anyone. My husband is generally awesome but after this incident, I have lost trust in him. He will not be my side when I really need him. I feel like keeping it a business deal even with my husband and stay out of it. It’s really frustrating.

One is the typical party that aspires to promote that vision but is fairly weak to do what's necessary and the other is also typical in a way that it knows that it is corrupt. The second type remains in bed with businessmen aka lobbyist, to do it's bidding, throwing tax breaks for the rich, or leasing large pieces of land for free etc. All they do is just pacify the citizens with their political rhetoric, but not actually help them.Case in point, the reason why we are witnessing a recession is because 12 people believe that demand is too high, and so they need to raise interest rates ""quickly"" (big mistake) causing unprecedented layoffs. They (both parties) know that the cause for increased inflation is GREED from the corporate types.

New,weLA86,How I use ChatGPT to improve my executive functioning at work - good for adhd/anxiety/depression,"As a job coach for tech professionals with ADHD, I'm always on the lookout for new tools to manage executive function challenges at work. I use ChatGPT regularly to help me break down tasks, estimate time, and draft difficult communications, but even better - I've noticed major reduction in my cognitive load and mental stress around tasks that used to stress me out more. I've also been collecting a list of prompts and use cases that have been particularly helpful for me and my clients.Task Initiation:The biggest executive function benefit is for TASK INITIATION. Writing is a Wall of Awful for so many people. ChatGPT reduces the cognitive lift for writing because it writes the basics and then all you have to do is edit. From an executive function perspective, it’s almost always easier to edit something instead of creating from scratch.Use Case: Use ChatGPT to do a first draft of emails, performance self-evaluations, bios, cover letters, and even text messages. Obviously, ChatGPT does not give you a perfect draft, but you can tweak it as needed with more prompts like “that draft was too formal, re-write it in a more casual tone”.Example Prompt: I want you to write an email to a stakeholder explaining that a project will be delayed due to a bug that needs to be addressed. The project will be delayed up to 1 week. Use a professional and assertive tone. Be apologetic but not overly apologetic.Results: https://imgur.com/1UW5HN3Communication and Rejection Sensitivity:Sometimes we don’t have the right language for a difficult conversation – especially ones where to need to self-advocate or respond to criticism. If you have Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria, it can feel paralyzing and stop you from communicating about an issue.Use Case: Use ChatGPT to draft scripts for difficult conversations, including predicting difficult questions or comments from the other person.Example Prompt: I (Jane) want you to help me prepare for a sensitive conversation with a customer (John). I need to tell the customer that their feature requests for their app are simply not possible unless we significantly extend the deadline. I want them to understand that ultimately, the feature requests are out of scope for this project and won't realistically happen. I don't want them to be angry about this. Write script of Jane breaking the news to JohnResults: https://imgur.com/pigzeakTime estimation and task breakdown:Everyone has a different ‘sweet spot’ with breaking down tasks. Breaking them down too small can make you feel overwhelmed with how many tiny things there are to do. Not breaking them down far enough can make it too ambiguous. ChatGPT can take an overwhelming task and break it down….and break it down….and break it down. It’s an amazing tool for creating a structured approach to a task.Use Case: Ask ChatGPT to break down a task that feels overwhelming. This is great for Wall of Awful tasks and ones where you’re not quite sure how to startExample Prompt: I have to schedule a doctor's appointment with Orlando Regional Medical Center to get an x-ray on my foot and I feel completely overwhelmed. I don't know if my insurance will cover the appointment, or even where to find my health insurance ID. I use Premera health insurance. I don't know who to call at the hospital and what information I should have ready. Can you give me step-by-step instructions to break down the steps of making this appointment?Results: https://imgur.com/njPoXTNOther cool use cases:Synthesize important information from this document into bullet points. Or, pull out action items from this email into a task list.Use it as a Watson to your sherlock, a rubberduck, or an interactive problem solving tool. “I want you to act as a rubberduck. I’m going to tell you a problem I’m having and I want you to ask clarifying questions and challenge my thought process. Prompt me to think about this problem in a different way and help me find a solution. Here is the problem:”Check out this giant list of fun and useful ChatGPT prompts to explore more on your own. This is the original article that sent me down the rabbit hole: https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-promptsSuper Obvious Disclaimer: While ChatGPT can be a useful tool for managing executive function challenges, remember it is not appropriate for handling confidential information.

It could just be my bias, but they literally were total wrecks and couldn’t hold a proper job, before they became therapists.

New,in_a_hole,Saying no to fiancee,"With the wedding coming up soon, the stress is building. I keep track of different arguments or fights that I have with my fiancee so that I can learn to navigate married life better. One pattern that has emerged is that I can't seem to find a productive way to say ""no"" to her. In these instances, the situation is that she'll want me to do something, I won't be onboard, and at the end of it all she will be upset.In each of these instances where she wants me to do something, it's not that she's wrong in her thinking of the task being a net value addition, but more that I estimate the level of effort and logistical planning and say that the opportunity cost of doing the task is too high. Typically with these instances, the cost/benefit is a bit murky, and so I am open to being convinced. I've tried saying ""let's think about it some more and revisit in a few days"" but her approach is more along the lines of ""no I need you to agree to this right now"" (at least, this is how I feel).I want to equip her with the tools to convince me gently instead of trying a steamroller approach. I tried telling her exactly that, but it was not well-received. What am I doing wrong here? Female opinions/perspectives particularly welcome.Edit: some people suggested ending things, which made me realize that I had misrepresented the frequency of our fights. I would say that about 1 in 15 of our interactions is negative, which is quite far from the 1:5 ratio where couples should consider breaking up.",,2/5/2023,29,905,3,Job Issues,Stress

We must also acknowledge and address the ways in which our actions and decisions may contribute to the oppression and marginalization of certain groups, and work to dismantle systems of power and privilege that perpetuate these injustices.In order to achieve this, we must commit to the following principles:We must prioritize the well-being of all members of the human family, not just those at the top of the corporate ladder. This means ensuring fair wages and benefits for all employees, and making sure that our business practices do not exploit or harm marginalized communities.We must work to reduce our environmental impact and strive for sustainable business practices.

Most people define success as obtaining status and wealth. In order to achieve this, you’ll find most people working long hours doing things they’re not passionate about in order to achieve “success”. The reason is that these things bring in much more wealth and status than normal things.I’ve seen the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich. I grew up on the east side of Cleveland but now spend most of my days in Palo Alto.These ultra rich people I’ve interacted with have some of the most messed up personal lives. Their families are held together by thoughts and prayers. They drink and do substances just to get through the day. Everybody only sees them for their dollar signs.On the other hand, as long as the basic needs are met.. some of the poorest people I’ve met are among the happiest. They have great senses of communities. They are the most welcoming to strangers.If people know this is what the end product of getting rich is like, why struggle for it all your life?

In the past year, my parents have divorced and I feel a responsibility to help my mom and be there for her. She supports my younger sister who has special needs and I want to be able to spend more time and help her as well. I feel a lot of guilt for not being there for them in the past couple years. I think about this often every day.They’re not within driving distance so I’d like to get a remote job so I can visit and stay them more without having to use all my PTO (and also be able to move to a large city where a lot of my friends from college live). For two months, I’ve been applying for internal jobs. There haven’t been very many remote openings, and the ones I’ve applied to I’ve been rejected from. Id like to stay at the company but have also applied to another companies with no luck.My life is just work, gym, eat, watch tv, sleep every day and I’m so tired of it.

Microsoft,QONg28,How to cleanse your work environment to rid it of perverse energies and influences,"A corporation is a super organism. Currently most corporations have a low consciousness and vibration. They have prioritized profit and short term gains over anything else. As an employee, you are a cell in this organism and have the power to change it. More so than you think. As you raise your vibration, you help the company to raise theirs. There are things you can do to clear, cleanse, power and protect your work environment to remove energetic blockages and facilitate this. Besides, doing so help you raise your own vibration as well. Here is one way you can lift up and elevate the corporation you either have worked at in the past or are currently employed with. I don’t recommend doing this for a specific corporation you have never had an association with. If you are advanced, you can do this for all corporations at once. Please be playful with this and follow your intuition, but never skip steps 2 and 3. It is not safe to do this without proper energetic protection. Also, avoid getting stuck in mind traps and simply let go and simply be as you do this.1. Sit or lie down in a comfortable and open body position. Open your mind by taking a handful of deep slow breaths to bring you in the here and now moment.2. Consciously connect to the god/goddess within you. It is important to set the intention, even if you are already connected. If you are struggling to connect, mentally reach within the stomach area and connect to the inner devine within you. Doing this gives you better results and also protects you. In this way, you are simply holding space for this transformation to take place. It is also highly beneficial to draw and maintain your attention to the space between your eyebrows. No need to force it or cross your eyes. Simply close your eyes and be aware.3. Call in arch angels of the horizontal plane (Rafael, Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel) as well as the vertical plane (Metatron and Samdalphon) to hold the space for you and keep you protected as you do this. Ground yourself into mother earth. (If you don’t know how, search for grounding meditation online). If you are advanced, open the entire central channel connecting heaven and earth.4. It is important that you energetically cleanse yourself first before tending to another. So imagine you are walking down a tunnel passing through multiple waterfalls of cleansing light or fire. Kind of like a car in carwash. First passing through ultra violet fire, then white fire, then gold fire, washing away anything that does not belong and energizing your energy field. Finally pass through a rainbow waterfall of light penetrating deep into every level and layer of your being, followed by a gentle lavender mist. By now your vibration is raised higher. An alternative is to ask archangel Michael to cut away all negative influences, connections and cords with his sword. Then ask archangel Metatron to seal your energy field with a thick layer of gold light from our sun, central sun, and great central sun.5. As an optional step, for extra protection, you can ask the angels to put etheric gloves on your hands.6. Now that you are ready, it is time to clear and cleanse your corporation of choice. Bring it into your attention. Visualize it creatively, perhaps as a pyramid with the CEO on top and employees on the bottom. See the shareholders, partners, vendors and contractors, physical assets such as buildings and furnitures as well as hardware, virtual assets such as source code and intellectual property.7. You can clear, cleans, power, and protect this corporation both as a whole and also in parts. It is recommended to ask for permission to proceed if you know how. If your intuition says you should not be doing this, please stop and don’t force it. Perhaps you can try another time. Instead focus on raising your own vibration in preparation for this. I suggest starting with the whole, iterating over the parts, and then coming back to the whole once more. There are multiple energies available to you to use here. To keep this briefe, I’ll mention just a few examples here. If you are a beginner, I suggest focusing on one specific light frequency of your choice in each session and then seal the energy field as will be described below.8. Start by ultra violet fire flowing like a waterfall from the top of the pyramid all the way down. Iterate over specific individuals or departments as needed. Otherwise, simply imagine the light flowing through all departments washing away or melting away any and all negative or low vibration influences. Transforming all dark energies into light. And upgrading all individuals into a higher vibration. Their energy fields, minds and emotions. Here is the protocol. Feel free to add what might be missing. Go through, all shareholders, major investors, board members, employees, various departments, contractors and vendors, partners, customers and consumers, influences from competitors, contracts, promises, vows, collaborations, intellectual properties and rights, buildings, furnitures, hardware, software and source codes, documentations, etc. If you are advanced, you can use multiple frequencies of light at once or consecutively. It is highly beneficial to ask Michael to cut all cords, threads, and influences that are not in the highest and greatest good of the company, its employees, and shareholders. The ruby red fire from archangel Uriel is extremely beneficial to use, since he is in charge of earthly structures and systems such as a corporation. Ask Uriel to ground it with ruby red fire, Gabriel to cleanse it with diamond white fire, Michael to protect it with electric blue fire and close down all negative portals along with their backup regeneration programs, and Raphael to heal it with emerald green fire. Archangel Sandalphon can both ground and recharge the enterprise with elemental energies of the earth. You can help it further by infusing it with heart energy, a golden pink light exuding from all your energy centers at once. You can also ask the angels holding the blueprint of any crystal or plant such as rose quartz and pink roses to assist you by sharing their energy. You can also enclose the entire corporation in clear quartz crystal or blue-silver or gold or even rainbow shield like a bubble to keep it protected from negative influences and dark energies.9. Once the cleansing is done, it is very important to seal it. I’d ask archangel Metatron to seal all the energy fields you touched with a thick layer of gold light from our sun, central sun, and great central sun to fill all tears, reaps, and gaps with light.10. End this meditation by asking that the effects of what you just did would be taken to the highest possible intensity for the highest possibility of love, light, and healing. Then thank and release all angels that assisted you in this process, while allowing the healing to continue until completion even after you end this meditation.Be well.",,2/24/2023,14,319,7,Family Issue,Others

Fortunately, I wasn't laid off in 2020, but our startup decided to cut 25% salary for 6 months back then.Then COVID stuff. Isolation part was not too bad. But I do have close relatives, who were very very sick and almost died. Seems like older ones have permanent damage now, especially in the brain department.I am from the former Soviet Union. I have relatives in Russia and Ukraine. The war there is tearing me apart. I cannot internalize it.

Indeed,tnlh17,Friend denying the obvious. Frustrated!,"My close friend works as a HF analyst. Starting from September, he had to take 6 months off due to a non-compete when changing funds.He used to have a shallow existence with much of his small amount of free time on app dates (6+ new dates a month). He was doing this for 3+ years since his last break up.Since having unlimited free time, this has really gotten to him as he can’t schedule enough dates to fill his time now and is realizing he has no one to share his time with. After first going on break he went on a 3 week solo trip to Europe. After which he expressed to me that he was feeling lonely on the trip.Long story short, he’s now in a relationship. What bothers me is that he’s denying that his loneliness or free time had anything to do with it. That he could have loved playing the field right now. As a close friend, it is obvious to me that that wasn’t his emotional reality.He just doesn’t want to believe that his emotional reality has anything to do with getting into a relationship. He’s claiming it’s because the girl is so great. Sure, maybe she is, but it bothers me he wants to deny other realities.As a friend, it is exhausting to try to talk to him about his emotional state when he denies the obvious.

Apple,IndiaMum,Frustrated Husband - what should i do?,"My personal life has been a hell past 4 yrs due to extreme differences with my wife. Our families visited around the time of our child’s birth 5 yrs back and that’s when our marriage started going down the dumps. We both are from India but from different states - i am from the West And she’s from the East. We had a love marriage and met each other at grad school.My TC is 350k and wife also works at a FAANG with similar TC and as such we are financially independent.At first I thought the differences would evaporate or could be mended in a couple of years if our families didn’t visit; however, 4 years later and having not visited India in last 6 yrs, nothing has really changed. There are days where I wonder if there is any love left between us. And I feel I am in the marriage because our Indian background with a kid being in the picture doesn’t give us the courage to divorce.Four years back, my Father in-law had told me on my face that he regrets marrying his daughter in my family and had called names to my mother due to misunderstandings that happened between my parents and in-laws. After that I lost all respect for him because I felt a 65 yr old man should have the decency to sit and discuss tough issues and not simply loose temper and call names. My relationship with my in-laws is cold and my wife also doesn’t interact much with my parents. My in-laws have also told my wife that they won’t visit again and are permanently stationed at their son’s house. They don’t seem to have the same affect for their daughter like they have for their son. My parents are also not able to visit due to my marriage issues despite of me being an only child.We have tried counseling for the last 1 year and I feel there has been some progress but my wife doesn’t think so and she has been very frustrated off late. She always tell me during arguments that she has to now accept how unsatisfactory her life is and if she keeps feeling the same way, she might hv to do something about it. I told her I still love her and would like to keep trying but she says I ramble a lot and doesn’t think I work on improving my behavior. If I try pointing out something in her, she says I am just demonstrating tit for tat behavior.I have now started feeling that divorce might be the best way rather than suffering every week and arguing in front of kid. This has also affected my performance at Apple.We live in California and I am also worried about child custody. Will it be split equally? I can’t live without my kid and have also tried being completely submissive to my wife’s demands but she is never satisfied.If anyone has experienced this situation and come out of it, please DM me.",,9/18/2022,157,6127,33,Indians Issue,Others

New,afkFor5brb,My brother won’t get help,"This all started this last July. The local police called me at 4 in the morning. My brother (26M) was downtown having a drug fueled freak out and the police asked me to buy him an eighty dollar cab to my apartment.My brother was initially living a city over from mine. Alot of my family, uncles and aunts live in the city my brother was in. I have a supportive and loving family there. They got my brother a good job when he first moved there a year ago. He had multiple family homes to visit and stay at until he saved up enough to get his own place.My point is he had all the support a young man could of had moving to the city. Within about half a year my brother picked up sniffing drugs he'd get from the streets. Meth, crack, coke, I'm assuming it didn't matter too much which. He managed to spend every dollar he made at a full time job with no bills on getting completely wrecked.He ended up burning bridges with most of the family there by not respecting their homes. Making a gross mess everywhere he stayed or being high and scaring people with his behavior. Talking to himself, being very emotional. He lost the job uncle got for him in a union job because he was using the break room to roll joints and listen to music.So he ends up in my city mid July. Does a bunch of meth in the middle of the night and has a freak out that led to him staying with me for a week. My brother stays at my and my roommates apartment for a week after the downtown freakout. During the week he has a few rather lucid and aware moments, mixed with some of the most delusional freaked out insane behavior I've ever seen from my brother. My roommate and I can't handle it after a solid seven days. I'm emotionally exhausted.My brother has accused me of stealing from him, my job, my apartment building. He's threatened to call the police on me because I try and get him to come to the hospital with me. He's tried to pick fights. I reach out and our father offers my brother a place to stay as my roommate has had enough and frankly so have I. I buy a bus ticket for my brother home and he's been staying with dad since late November. Now my poor father has had enough. My brother has decided being emotionally mentally and physically abusive to our father is acceptable. Every couple days now I talk with dad and it's either a good day where my brother is okay and admitting he needs professional help, or a more common bad day where my brother is cruel and says horrible things to our father.I'm so tired of waking up and fearing for my families well being. My brother obviously needs help but he won't go willingly. I live in San Jose and am going to look into what can be done to get my brother to get help as he won't do it on his own. I'm not sure why I'm sharing this story but it's been the heaviest weight in my life all year. I have zero experience in this and would appreciate any advice or support that I can find.

Amazon,fedexo,Delay in having kids,"33yo tc 300kBeen living in bay area for 5 years.Me n wife have been trying to have kids for almost 2 years now. We did get pregnant last year but turned out ectopic and had to abort. Really messed up her cycles for ~ 6 months. Just as it was recovering we both got covid and cycles messed up again. Doctors say we should keep trying but am quite depressed with all the failed tries.It seems the fantasy of having a family keeps getting farther and farther. I'm happy with my job but truly believe in family being more important. In mid 30s there's really nothing else much to look forward to except kids for me. Also I know our parents (although they don't push us) also have nothing else much to look forward to. I feel sad that after all the planning we do for our lives and career, the most important things are beyond our control. It feels the life inside us is dimming and having a child would be such a positive rush of love in the family.Other stuff like buying a house, saving for future etc feels pointless if there's no next generation to nurture.Curious to hear experiences of others who have been in similar place in life and how did you cope.Edit : I'm overwhelmed by the number of positive responses. Thank you folks! I'm going through each one and taking notes to act on. Few details- wife is 31yo, we've both had fertility checks (not from ivf specialists though) at Kaiser and theyvecome out normal.. hence doctors keep saying to continue trying.

I'm just late to the game and have been living under a rock.When I come out of regular hot shower, I am shivering. Cold shower is a different story, because the outside air is warmer than the ice cold water LOL. But what's interesting is that the cold shower makes me less susceptible to feeling cold throughout the day (like right now I'm just waring a t-shirt whereas I'd normally be wearing a sweater or hoodie on top).It's not easy by any means. Every single morning has been a struggle. The shock from the cold is something else. But this morning the furnace was repaired and I had hot water again. But I took a cold shower anyway.

I wasn’t ever told I’m measured on these things. If I performed my goals and worked on the feedback I was told I’m good.All of the year end feedback was good.Manager & skip rate me very very low. I get no annual increase, close to nothing in bonus.I ask why and seek for examples it’s not given. I’m told to ensure & write down that “I reply to emails, accept meeting invites, and small silly things” —> all of these I already do and never miss doing them. However, they choose to not see it.I see people who have been in the role for 3 months/ few grads in other team rated way higher. Only difference is their manager is better.There has been a lot of bias, I’m the only one of color in the team, and I feel excluded. I spoke with vp and I was told this year we’ll measure better.I feel very broken.

I have ADHD and have history with depression(former therapist thinks I may have OCD as well but this is undiagnosed), this made things very difficult for most of college, won’t go into details I’m sure many understand. I got a job in robotics I’ve been working the last year and I’m doing pretty okay at it.Problem is I know this isn’t really for me, it’s not particularly challenging and not where I want to take my career. I’ve been job searching again and my god has it been so difficult to focus and study/prep. It’s been so difficult to just sit down and focus on take home projects and I can’t believe it’s this hard, makes me feel a little self destructive after getting interviews at top companies I can’t even focus enough to study or complete take homes for the next stages.I’m not exactly heartbroken about it or anything but holy cow if it’s this difficult to get anything done that progresses my career I kinda fear sometimes that I’ll be stuck at a job I don’t want, making myself look busier than I am and being far less productive than everybody thinks I am - and if this keeps going I’ll prob be found out within the year.It’s 5:30am and I’ve been up since 3am scrolling my phone anxious about finishing the take home project I had that was due yesterday….I’m telling myself I’ll use this morning to work on it and turn it in late.I know I need meds but the healthcare system is very overwhelming to navigate.

Call it a mid-life crisis or what not... and while just thinking about what to do with my life, I had enough time to read through Blind posts and kinda became addicted to it. Then I asked myself what it is that makes many of us come here to discuss TCs and careers with anonymous/strangers.I don't know about you, but I guess part of the reason why I come is for validation. The validation that the big penis TC makes it all ok. But that's not really true, is it? For those of you who own pretty much everything you need to live a good life, and some more, do you really believe that money can buy all of your heart's desire?Maybe it does for you, but I realized many of the things that I truly desire are things that money can never buy. Companionship, friendship, health, really fit body, etc.I think the more I read blind, the more I realize that a lot of us including myself may be living someone else's life. A good WLB does wonders and get to let you think about what it is that you want with your life. I was going through some depression & burnout but I think taking a few weeks off and taking the time off to be introspective helps a ton. Perhaps, it's time we all stop living someone else's life and just ask ourselves what it is that we truly want. You don't need to seek validation from someone else, especially not here on blind.#burnout #depression**edit: purposefully left my tc out as it may distract the message I am trying to send: chasing tc is someone else's dream, not my own. have a roof over my head, cars to drive from point A to B, and eat yummy food every single day, and yet I still feel unfulfilled.

You don't go to work. Your partner can't be the be all end all - and also I can't share everything with him. Also he does feel a bit insecure so I avoid certain interactions that might trigger it.

However, I still feel like it's not a walk in the park that I will land a role and on top of that of these 3 onsites I had in the past, I have my heart set on one of the companies and particular, but I know that fixating on one company is not helpful. Obviously, I'd love to get at least one offer in general and it would greatly reduce the amount of stress and pressure I currently am feeling.

Micron,qreoct,Story of my life!,"Indian guy, grew up - I would say barely made it - in lower middle class family of 4 (parents, elder sister and I), I still remeber living in a chawl 10x10 living room, 8x8 kitchen, with tin roof shed overhead, no toilet in house. Always a makeshift bathroom (did not have 4 walls) using just piece of cloth tied on 2 side, we would take turns to bathe, we would also wash dishes, clothes there, water had to be brought from a shared tap outside out the house. Father worked double shifts, rode bicycle 20 km/day for commute, managed to get loan to buy 1 room and kitchen flat/apartment. seeing all this, while growning up, I always lived under fear of losing whatever my family had. Luckily I was decent at studies. Father used all his saving to put me through engineering with a promise that I make it a success. Failure was not an option. AGAIN lived under fear of not making it a success. Unfortunate thing happened, father lost his job (my elder sister was still unmarried and I was in 3rd year of engineering). Main source of income was gone. Family savings, including retirement saving, were 7Lakh (~10k USD), not to mention, we did not have any kind of insurance. It was a big shock, I still remember my mom, sis, and I crying together out of fear) Family did not give up. Mom was ready to sell her 'mangalsutra'. Father scrambled to find job, whatever he could earn, started from 5K INR a month(<100USD), I started helping, tutored students enrolled in 3-year engineering diploma courses, gave the income earned from it to the family. Worked hard, studied hard, got a job in a good IT company in India, Meanwhile sister got married, dad found a better job 25k INR/month (<400USD). Things looked better. I paid back cost of engineering to my father within the first 2 years of my job. Slogged 60-70 hours/week in the company to get good promotions/bonus etc. It worked. Boss was impressed, sent me to onshore location for 1.5 years. First time sat in a plane, earned enough money to take care of parent's retirement.For the first 23/24 years of my life, whatever I remember, I have always lived under fear. Mainly the fear of not having enough savings to survive. Fear of getting poor grades (because that would have resulted in financial trouble for the family), fear of losing job, fear of financial turmoil such as 2008 recession (that would have also resulted in financial trouble for the family), . I think now that fear of not having sufficient savings has stayed with me, I feel its wired in my brain now.Story continues. When I had enough savings, for the first time in 23/24years, I started to think about myself. I had always given my family's welbing highest priority over my welbeing. But now I wanted to study for myself, for further betterment of family(you see - somehow since I was luckily good at studies, I could offer a helping hand to my family). Fortunately, I had saved enough money to somehow pay for the tution cost of 1 year of relatively cheap US university for MS. That was the most difficult decision of my life i.e. to use all my savings and invest in my education. But then it triggered that fear of failure again! I had to be sucecssful to get a job after MS. Worked my ass off. Got 4.00/4.00 GPA. Got intership, that paid for large chunk of the 2nd year's tuition. when I was 26, I had a fulltime job offer and 9K USD savings. This was the moment when I thought I did justice to my family and myself, that I took care of their retirement/old age and also managed to educate myself. I was looking forward to life.All along this journey, I had started to like my highschool friend (she also had difficult financial background). We had similar struggle story. My family's financial welbeing getting good, but her family's financial welbing was deteriorating due to several reasons. I helped her as much as I could. She helped me as much she could. Our liking for each other turned into us getting married.4 years into marriage (which was a long distance marriage all along because of type of professions we were in, workplace restrictions and we were focusing on our careers first), when she also had good job, I also had a good job, she sent a divorce notice to me. I was shattered. Hit rock bottom, gosh that feeling! it was terrible. I would not wish it even for my worst enemy. Yes we did have typical husband-wife arguments, sometimes big fights, but this was unexpected. I suggested marriage couselling to both of us. Tried to talk her out of it. but did not work. I always strived for her betterment. She was back of my mind every day of the year. All attempts at living under one roof had failed. (its long strory)During the divorce she claimed some 30k USD of my savings. Did not have even a decent closure.Now, 2 years after divorce, I finally feel better. BUT my fear of failure is not going away. This fear of failure pops its head as fear of losing something valuable one one way or the other. I thought when I had my full time job in US, I had made it in life, but the divorce shook my entire belief system. I am okay now, I am hopeful about future, started working hard again, getting recognized, but I fear that something bad and big might happen again and push me down again.How do I get rid of this fear of failure once and for all. I feel sometimes it restricts me from reaching my full potential. I cant take it anymore if life gives me another blow. Luckily I have few very good friends back in India. They helped me a lot. My family back in India is good. I care for them. I may also get a new job with TC of 300K pretty soon, but now my fear of failure is coming alive again.I am not complaining about the cards I have been dealt with. I was determined all along this journey. But now I am starting to get exhausted, because of constrant struggle I had to go through. Sometimes I feel alone in this journey, wish I had a companion to tough it out with. I have some good friends in US but not close enough to share such details. I am the only engineer and first and the only person in the entire faimily tree to have immigrated outside India.On the brighter side, I have started giving back to this beautiful country called USA. Volunteering/donating my time and money in local community, especially for causes such as STEM education, finacially struggling families etc through NGOs, workplace CSR activities. That gives me the feeling that I am knowingly/unknowingly helping someone who has similar struggle.Anyways, such a long post. It just helps to simply pen down such thoughts!",,11/13/2021,417,37600,1048,Indians Issue,Others
AMD,PeakyPea,"Don't like the job, wanna quit. But scared AF","I don't like my job and honesty thinking of quitting each and every day. Not because the company or the team is bad, but I feel demotivated and kinda got depressed lately (as I don't really enjoy what I am doing anymore in general).I am about to close my financial liabilities soon, but it will leave me with little to none risk buffer money for the future if I do it and then quit.I thought maybe I'd give myself more time in a company, see how I like it there, get some experience check how they work with salary reviews /rsu upgrade/bonuses - so forcing myself to work anyways. Yet in the meantime prioritise $ collecting money as a safety buffer and fix my and my dependants' health issues.I am scared to live now with no money and this economy situation is driving me crazy (everything is freaking expensive). Plus I am scared AF cause with recent layoffs there are a lot of smart ppl out there seeking for a job. So if I am to be unemployed for some time, it's gonna be hard to get back on the ship.Lastly, as I don't enjoy what im doing, how do I find out if I am kinda strict on budget?What's your thoughts:A) just I just suck it up, work on financial liabilities, fix health, create a 💰 buffer AND take sabbatical?B) fix financials and health and then quit with little to none savings?C) other option (please comment)Appreciate your help!TC: around 90k given economy/stock price#burnout #mentalhealth",,1/27/2023,21,663,2,Layoff Issue,Burnout

Magic Leap,Bznz47,Gaslighting wife,"She does this to me in every aspect of the word, relentlessly. We fight literally about the smallest of things - using too much toilet paper, scratching the coffee table, my perceived incompetence, etc. Then she gets all worked up because once again I didn't comprehend exactly what she was saying the first time. She labels me an idiot and goes on a rampage, taunts me, shames me, orders me around, asks hurtful rhetoric questions and demands replies (""yes just admit that you are stupid""). In the beginning I try best not to be defensive (mostly saying silent), calling a timeout several times (she refuses), doing what she commands (to a point). She crosses the line in many ways, shoving, kicking, throwing my personal belongings on the floor. I feel hatred, it's like I'm doing all of the enduring while she gets to whip me around without consequences and remorse. Historically I am/have to be the level-headed one, while she gets to be however expressive she wants, play the threat of divorce card, butcher me, whatever. This time I choose to taunt her back by calling her a b*tch, which honestly doesn't feel satisfying, but she really needs to taste her own medicine. I don't care if I'm swooping down her level because I'm tired of being the level-headed one all the time. There is a difference between being a jerk once a while versus being one all the time.What do I want? She needs to friggin' apologize first, realize the things she's doing/saying are not okay. She has a lot of ego so I do not expect that to happen. Times like these feel she really sucks as a person and it's rooted by the fact that she hates me.

For instance, when I had a miscarriage last year she was asking my mom if I had ""issues"" that could prevent me from having a child. She literally told every one about my personal experience without even checking if I am mentally prepared to answer questions from extended family. She is interested in her son and her grandkids well beings and treats me and my family as a collateral baggage. Unfortunately, she is not even subtle about her behavior.My mom on the other hand is very sensitive and cannot let go of things. I asked her multiple times to avoid having any conversation with my mom in law. Me and my husband are fine if they are not on talking terms But instead my mom will talk to my mom in law and when she hears anything that is offensive from her will spiral and complain and whine to me.I dont think it is feasible for my mom-in-law to change. I cannot ask my husband to avoid bringing in his old mother to stay with us for a few months once in 2 years or correct her relentlessly every time she is offensive. I have learnt to forgive her and accept her as is, and focus on the fact she is a caring and loving mom and grandmother. I know my husband understands her shortcomings and we just ignore and work with her when she comes over.As for my mom, I told her she can completely disconnect from her and stop talking to her.

His parents have been gaslighting him for years, assigning him menial mindless work, which should be done by someone with a high school diploma while the company sputters along, barely surviving.His parents have tried unsuccessfully to sell the business for years, though he has the background and networking connections to help with accomplishing that goal. Assuming that they can't sell it, they do not want to let him take it over which adds insult to injury.He has a college degree and has experience working at other tech companies of various sizes, though he rarely is able to stay at a company for a long time - mostly because he has toxic managers who screw him over and let him go before they are fired themselves. Oddly enough, his managers consistently get new leadership jobs and sometimes even get promoted, leaving my friend decimated and forced to return to his dead-end role with his parents.His family business is supposedly about to get a couple of enormous sales, which will require him to stay in his dead-end role working harder than ever despite the obvious need to move him into a position which would be a better fit. He has tried countless times to convince his parents to move him into such a role, but they are convinced that they either don't need his help in those functions (lie) and they end up giving them to people who are far less qualified which perpetuates this dysfunctional cycle which is taking a toll on his mental and physical health.He was told he could quit, which opens up a lot of other issues with his family, so he is scared and doesn't know what to do at this point. He's a white male in his 50s which means he will have a much harder time getting a job -- after all companies want to hire people who are younger, are not male and preferably nor white -- after all diversity is the big trend nowadays.What would you tell him to do?#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #dead-end",,1/19/2023,25,1066,,Family Issue,Burnout

I was planning on graduating a semester early but I don't know anymore.I had to do a surgery 4 months ago to remove a cyst but the surgeon admitted he cut a little deep and I literally lost enough tissue to make a gap on my the right side of my lips. It is almost constantly on my mind about how disfigured it looks to have it look like the right side of my lip is chipped off / hole in between my lips because there isn't enough tissue on the bottom lip to meet the top lip.I look at old photos compared to myself now and I want to fucking rip my hair out. Believe me, I am NOT a superficial person, but everyday I wake up and see my disfigured lips and think about my life before this bullshit happened to me.

Microsoft,wonder-ing,Has anyone ever woken up and thought: how did I end up in this/my life?,"Hi all,Is it common for people to regularly wonder ""how did I end up in the life I choose for myself""? I have had this question on my mind alot this past year 2022. My life looks good on the outside I guess but it feels like it isn't aligned with who I am or just feels unfulfilling.I think in my early years I made alot of ""fight or flight"" survival choices because my parents immigrated to a country (under harsh circumstances, fleeing their country) and I never truly was able to be myself, and learn who I actually am as a child. I was raised to fit in a box. I chose my university degree because of what looks good and what can get me a job. I didn't date certain people because my parents wouldn't approve. I ended up like ""everybody"" else instead of who I actually am. I work in tech even though I think I would rather live an unconventional, simple life somewhere in Costa Rica (or similar) on the beach. Lately, I have been at work and I would look around the office and just think wtf, what am I doing here? It is not that my work environment is bad but I just feel totally out of place and like I have to play a role. I look around and wonder; does everybody else also play a role or are they actually enjoying the workplace?It has started to affect my sleep, and general happiness. I am now in my 30s, female and wonder if it is too late to start a new life?! I am single and have dated lots of men but have just not been ""feeling it"" with anyone. I guess the reason is also that deep down I am not happy in myself. I am also scared if I meet a man and we have a child that I will be stuck in a life & career where it won't be as easy to get out anymore, as without a child.Is this a life experience anyone shares? I am asking this because I feel like I have too many things that I need to solve and change, like it is almost too much at once. How have people made such big transitions and changes? Any advice? One thing to note; I have tried different lifestyles, such as living in foreign countries, living low-key on a beach, and preferred it for sure but always came back to my safe haven. Somehow I must have a deep-rooted believe that I can't let go of this safe life. Also a little scared to leave such a well-paying job and maybe be unhappy somewhere else.Sorry about the long text. I feel like if I speak to friends, they just tell me that it is all not so bad and I am in a good place etc... How would you navigate this situation?

Udemy,AlxF37,I feel insecure,"I would say I'm in a good position in life in general, but I feel insecure. It's like threat is all around and I just dodge one after another until one hits me.Some examples:- I might lose my job at any point of time for any reason or no reason. Even if I have money, I still need to have job for health insurance and avoiding job gap. Coworkers are śtupid and at any point of time can complain about me to the manager which I'm always defenseless about.- Aggressive/violent people show up everywhere specially in nightclubs. If I'm small I'm subject to intimidation, if I'm big and fight I might get arrested or sued.- I can get into car accident, either be hurt or end up in prison.- I can get sued or falsely accused for anything at any point of time.- Landlord can evict me for no reason and cause me to never be able to rent again.- Anybody can impersonate me and post damaging things under my name on the internet and ""cancel"" me.The list goes on, and in most of the cases, I'm defenseless.

Google,nailenvy,Fight for a friendship or cut them off?,"I hardly have any friends that live near me and that I can meet regularly. Last year I made a new friend and we quickly bonded and I thought we were developing a really close friendship (she was at my very small wedding, we had many deep conversations, and shared fun experiences).Lately I've been feeling like she's no longer making an effort to stay connected. E.g. we have only met twice in the past few months, she rarely invites me to join gatherings anymore, and the 1 time she did was at the very last minute, takes almost no interest in me (I'm pregnant and she never checked up on me), and is recently not really engaging in texting back either. I called to make sure she's ok, and she is ok, but ""very busy"".I'm debating if I should bring this up with her directly to share how I feel and maybe try to salvage the friendship, or let it go and accept the friendship is over.I've always thought that in cases like this, confronting someone isn't a good strategy because (1) it's a really hard uncomfortable conversation; (2) it'll just make things more awkward, to the point of no return, so what's the point? and (3) if someone doesn't care enough or is too busy or what not, that's out of my control so better to just cut them off.But maybe I'm wrong??

New,uRaoV,Having a very stressful few weeks. Personal and professional both.,"1. My grandma, who has been bedridden and living in the nursing home the past few years, recently developed serious viral infections and was hospitalized. My mom and I flew there to check in, but there’s not much we could do. It’s hard to see her in so much pain even though we weren’t very close in my teenage and adult years. And it’s sad that my mom will have to experience the loss very soon.2. My own mother also has some health issues. There’s literally so many appointments for me to handle and these offices are open only during business hours, so I have to squeeze in time to call them individually, and be on hold for several minutes. It follows with constant talking and repeating the same information.3. My mom is on Medicaid and the insurance barely covers anything. So these appointments are breaking my bank.4. I experienced a credit card fraud. I called to get it canceled. Thankfully, this process was smooth.5. I am developing weird skin symptoms and they’re very itchy and some painful. I have to now make another doctors appointment for myself.6. Today, I heard from my estranged father’s sister (estranged aunt) who called to inform us that our father is ill. Without giving much context - and we haven’t even talked in ~20 years - she began to drop phrases to guilt trip us. It even felt as if she didn’t call us to inform us about the actual health conditions.Not even sure what she was implying. I ended up cursing her out - I think I blew things out of proportion but she triggered a lot of pain by saying way too much shit. After lashing out at her, I don’t feel like I’m ready to call her again (especially considering I told her to never contact us again out of spite). And I don’t trust her - she’s not a very honest person and was behind my father’s affairs during his marriage with my mom, and she later shifted the blame to my mom. But I worry I might regret later. I really don’t know what feelings I have towards my father.Wrote a long rant here:https://us.teamblind.com/s/HskBkZiX7. Workload is insane - I am starting to feel so burnt out.

New,uRaoV,Dying loved ones (an estranged person),"Ok so not a loved one. But a complex one.My (estranged) father was an abusive and unfaithful parent who caused a lot of pain and trauma to my mother, sister, and myself. The night that we left, he was about to get physically abusive and had to call the police and run out, and he locked us out. We cut ties with him for almost a decade due to his mistreatment and manipulation, but reconnected later just a few years ago (around 2019). However, he continued his gaslighting behavior and his former mistress continued to harass my family by calling my mom/sister and insinuating things. Additionally, he would demand that we (my sister and I) treat his former mistress that he continued to keep in touch with with respect. We got sick of it so we decided to sever ties again.Today, our estranged aunt, who had helped our father cover up his infidelity and pretty much was a b*tch to my mother as her sis-in-law, contacted my sister to inform us that our father was ill. During the conversation, she started justifying our father's recent actions and his mistress, and began guilt-tripping my sister about how she’s not checking in with him despite him getting sick, which caused my sister to lose her cool and lash out. I was working at the home office downstairs and overheard the conversation, and I also got upset and intervened and took over the phone, telling our aunt to stop with the lies and insults. I told her not to f*cking call us again and that she should feel ashamed for calling us and disrupting peace, when we’re all working hard and trying to get over trauma.Despite my behavior, I feel guilty about how I handled the situation and couldn’t regulate my emotions. I should’ve just taken the phone to hang up, and not lash out. I feel like shit for not taking the high road. Partially since our father is dying, partially because I didn’t act like the same one, and partially because I feel like this behavior shamed my mom. However, the experience of learning about his infidelity as a child and how he shamelessly continued it even into adulthood has been very traumatic for me and my family. And his sister calling us and gaslighting / guilt-tripping didn’t help.Had my father made genuine efforts to reconnect with us, not throw shades and make us acknowledge his mistress of 20 years as our mom/grandkid’s grandma, we probably would not have severed ties.Should I call the aunt back? She was being shady and unclear to my sister about the conditions of my dad, and only said things that were triggering. She is basically a flying monkey next to my narcissistic father.So we don’t know what is going on. The bitterness inside of me is upset that they’re only reaching out because they have nowhere to go, but then I feel guilty (because I am a nicer person than them).",,2/22/2023,13,396,,Family Issue,Stress

Meta,monigoal,NYC has been a tough disappointment to swallow,"I moved to NYC from SF 3 years ago right before the pandemic. I’ll be moving back to SF soon and thought I’d share some little known things about living here:- people are colder and harder to talk to. Not unfriendly, but too overstimulated to make any attempts at befriending you- Californians speak with the purpose of entertaining. NYers speak with the purpose of informing- everyone (everyone!) is overworked, stressed, and at best tolerates their job to climb an endless career ladder. SF is filled with weird nerds who geek out about their craft, NYC is filled with husks of people proudly grinding- nobody feels like they have enough- there’s a LOT to do here and is hands down one of the best parts about the city. Good luck trying to get on anyone’s calendars to build up any kind of consistent and close friendship. If you love doing things, move here. If you love getting to know people well, don’t.- the goal of dating is to fuck first, ask questions later. I’m female, and I’m not at all interested in this game of bland-and-indiscriminately-“nice” dates with men who want to say the generically right things to fuck by date 1.5. If you’re a man who likes this, move here- the things you want to do will fill up your days and weeks until you’re haggard and exhausted, but you can’t stop the cycle of more more more more more- if California is fake-nice, then nyc is fake-cool.

Ik if my girlfriend did the same thing I’d be so mad. 1) for studying and for being flirty with her. 2) for going over to her placeI am fucking devastated and can’t believe I gave in to my urges to even go to another girls place. We didn’t do anything but I entertained it. I have an amazing gf and maybe it’s the long distance that has been tough. We also almost broke up recently so mentally I was somewhat checked out of the relationship. It’s not a valid excuse, but that’s definitely a big part of it.Is what I did considered cheating or is cheating when you fully do something?Pls avoid trolling. This situation is taking a toll on my mental and I haven’t even been able to study for interviews. #mentalhealth",,10/19/2022,69,3888,15,Others,Mental Health

Tempus,WxYp77,How do y'all focus at work?,"Lately, I've been way too distracted at work to truly dig into the tasks on my to-do list. There are multiple factors causing that, and I respond to them in odd ways. Some examples:1. When I'm reading a doc that's too long (requires a long attention span), I zone out. If I'm home, I'll grab my phone and start scrolling through Instagram. If I'm at the office, I'll still want to pick my phone up but won't, and instead, I'll just pretend to read the doc (move my eyes around the screen or rock in my chair) so it feels like I'm still into it. I'll keep doing that until I have the capacity to focus again2. I like making to-do lists with atomic tasks. And then I forget I made a to-do list a few hours after making one. Recently, I've been setting alarms to look at my to-do lists. I hate the Reminder notifications on my iPhone. And the alarms don't work because when I get back home (after a ""nice"" 35-minute bus ride), I forget how important finishing those tasks is. I simply cancel the alarms and push the tasks to the next day at work where surprise-surprise, I have new tasks to doObviously, I still have my job because I've been working weekends when deadlines are near. I find it easier to focus when my ass is on fire. But that's not how I want to live. I want to be able to focus every day. If not for the full 8 hours, then at least 2-3 hours because that's enough for me to get my work done.I also have to use my work laptop to check my to-do list because we're not allowed to have any work-related data on personal devices. And we get nothing more than a laptop. It feels overwhelming to get back home and turn on the work laptop just to look at lists or read notes. During my internships, I used to take notes in my personal Evernote, and then use my personal iPad to casually switch between games, social media, and my notes.I'm aware that if I'm able to truly focus for at least 2-3 hours a day, I can finish all my tasks AND write some of the most beautiful code ever written (per my ability).What techniques have worked for you?Blind tax: $140k",,12/15/2022,36,921,4,ADHD,Others

It's a choice between patriarchal slavery and capitalistic slavery. I really don't know what to do and keep wanting to end everything every morning.I have been going to therapy and my therapist is surprised how my company treats its employees.

They usually have to do it at least every 60d, sometimes every 30d, so basically at least twice for a 12w FMLA LOA.People then go around to LeetCode and interview at other companies to get a job before the LOA runs out. Is your therapist aware that you're doing this? Is that okay? #fmla #amazonbenefits #amazonaws #amazon #tech #burnout #depression #mentalhealth #amazonpipEDIT: A lot of people have jumped to the wrong conclusions in the comments. I want to point out that if you're actually so anxious and depressed that you CANNOT make yourself do any interviews during the LOA, then it actually means the exact opposite: you're not ready to return back to work at all.Getting better is a gradual process. There are a lot of bad therapists out there, and absolutely zero guidance how you're supposed to get yourself out of this situation where getting better might mean getting worse, and vice versa.Casual reminder that when you're taking penicillin, you're supposed to complete the entire course. If you stop the treatment midway, there's a risk that you'll end up with penicillin resistant bacteria. I think Mental Health is the same way. It's irresponsible for a therapist to send you back before you're ready to go back. Being ready usually does mean that you're capable of completing interviews, and have at least some offers to alleviate the anxiety.",,12/4/2022,39,1324,1,Therapist Issue,Burnout

New,EWS68,Stress,"Stress is the root cause of many psychosomatic illnesses, personality disorders, addictive behaviors, rising healthcare costs, and crime of white collar and street corner varieties. Of both physical and mental distress. Often, stress is self-inflicted, it is a personality trait, and is also the result of external factors.The big, overarching external factor contributing to stress is the relentless and systemic humdrum and dynamics of industrial capitalism: the constant drive for growth in monetary terms, the consequential growth-driven personal career progression for more money and power in the workplace, and the irony of what it means with and without it for our lifestyles, personal lives, and families.Its economics is the “C” in the output equation Y=C+G+I+NX. The purpose of all other variables on the right side is to keep raising C and, hence, Y or growth. This drives corporate strategy and politics. This is the economic model we all live in.We all need to take a deep breath, step outside ourselves, and reflect on this one seemingly simple equation at the heart of neoclassical economics and its implications for the planet and ourselves.Leadership in large measure is managing your own stress and enabling others you lead to manage their own.#mentalhealth",,2/1/2023,4,672,13,Job Issues,Stress

Square,rodndbfb,Impulsive breakup regret,"Gay man here. In a 7 months relationship and never had any arguments until a few days ago.At first, partner blew up over something “laughable”. Partner wanted to take a break. I felt hurt and was impulsive. One drama after another, I threatened to break up despite partner wanted to work things out. Eventually partner gave up and agreed to break up. He seemed very determined that my immaturity and impulsive behavior would be a problem and I would threaten to break up again and it won’t work out. I begged him to reconsider but he rejected.I then realized how much he meant to me and how scared I actually am of losing him. I sent a message to say I regret things and how happy I have been, he responded he wish I had said that sooner instead of breaking up with him, and asked me to stop texting him for a few days.I feel like an asshole and don’t know how to approach the situation for a second chance. I am willing to do anything to get us back together and working on my impulsiveness issue. Is there still a chance? What is this thing in me? How soon should I reach out again?

Cisco,MsAt87,Feels like I picked the wrong major and have to live with the consequences,"Just needed to get this off my chest, apologies if it's incoherent. Could also use some words of advice.I majored in Industrial Engineering and followed that up with a master's in Engineering Management. And now I'm a quality engineer at one of the largest tech companies in the world. I should be overjoyed with my evident success and rejoicing in the fruits of my labor.But I'm not. I didn't realize till I was halfway through my master's program that I actually didn't like what I was doing at all. I would complain to my peers how boring my upper-level courses were, thinking that it was pretty normal, and they would look at me funny and tell me how they didn't relate at all and that they thought it was exhilarating and they could see themselves doing it for the rest of their lives. This confused me until I realized that in fact, most people do really enjoy the things they study, and perhaps I was in the wrong program. But, with only 6 months left, it was too late to switch.Now, I'm a quality engineer, and while I don't mind Cisco as a company, the actual work of being a quality engineer is mind numbing. Most days I WFH, starting late and ending right at 5pm, with minimal productivity, in order to avoid torturing myself with this inane BS. I'm working on the CS50 AI class right now and finding it much more interesting, fun, and stimulating than my actual job. So it's clear to me that I should have gone the software engineering route. But it's also becoming increasingly clear to me that without a degree in SWE or CS, I don't stand a chance at passing the grueling technical interviews that even graduates from top SWE/CS programs have a hard time passing.I feel like I majorly screwed up when I was 17 years old, and I'm now stuck in a career I don't want to be in with no way out. Bootcamps don't feel like the answer, because they're mostly vocational training rather than a real education, and they almost exclusively focus on web/app development (which may or may not be what I want to go into - I need help figuring that part out too). As for going back to school and doing another 4-year degree, I don't think I have the money or the stamina to do that. Self-taught? Maybe, but I don't know where to start with that.What recourse do I have here? Or do I just have to accept the consequences of my 17-year-old self's decisions and just put in the hours in an unfulfilling career to survive, and hopefully make a fulfilling life out of my evenings and weekends?(NB: I know the last paragraph is overly dramatic, and there has to be a way out of this.

I recently joined after learning about it from Tumblr (I know right) but have been sorely disappointed and sympathetic after reading the posts in this topic section.It seems at odds that such a fiscally sensitive community is struggling so much in their inner lives. I grew up in a financially turbulent household and have definitely experienced green eyes after reading some of the more lucrative posts here.I make very little money (compared to y'all, but irl like 70k$ a year) and I pay way too much for rent. My whole apartment is 400 square feet. My work in finance does not thrill me (although I *am* leaving the company...); it's never been an interest and the constant screen time gets intense. I've never had a passion for taking up hobbies and at this point I've stopped trying. My family is across state and we only see each other twice a year, while my list of friends could be counted on one hand. I'm a single girl in a big city, who's never had a serious relationship! I dont drive. My actual, real commute to work, that I have to do 4-5 days a week--is one hour each way and the bus is always packed.Despite this, I am thrilled with everyday of my life. I revel in it. I am so grateful to be alive even when I walk past the piss in the street on my way to the bus. Seeing my friends is more rare than I'd prefer, but we do things we actually like to do. My home is teensy but I have it totally arranged to my taste and liking. Even though I've always wanted to find my soulmate, I've given up the dating game and I can 100% say i'm better for it. Really y'all, at some point you realize being awkward on first dates is way less fun than just trying the funky restaurant on your own because you really want jamaican oxtail.If this reads like a humble brag it's because it low key is. I love my life that much.BUT more importantly, I hope it is comforting.I love that everyone is chasing their bag but please on god put some of that to good use and take care of the animal creature that you are. There are so many ways to build your life into something uniquely for you. We don't have to compare ourselves to anyone else because everyone else is thinking just as much about themselves as we do. Literally no one is looking at you at any time so you might as well ball.Start getting over the fear you'll be miserable forever so that you can actually start doing stuff you like. Or will learn to like. Break that self fulfilling prophecy babe.Go to the movies, catch a matinee, and sneak a bit of rum for your coke icee. Go to your farmers market and see the stylish couple and seethe that you're alone and then get over it and remember that you are capable of just as much joy alone as they have together and get the 12$ loaf of sourdough and eat it with a lot of bread and butter and feel like a milkmaid from the 11th century.

Couple of our friends and us bought home when it was new construction. Slowly it became a tight nit community among Indians. There were social activities and gathering almost every other week. My wife made the worst mistake of putting all her social connection within the community.As my son disability started showing up, there were 2 main people who started feeling like we should not live in this community anymore. Asians, specially Indians, have a large population of ""ableist"". They flock around kids who are superior thinking that peer pressure might do wonders for their own kid. But on the flips side, many of them just hate kids with disability.They started convincing other families to cut us off by saying false things about us and my son. The Indian kids stopped playing with my son, their families stopped inviting us on any of the kids social events. These things really devastated my wife and impacted her mental health. My son is also disturbed by these events.I thought that these activities by Indian is limited in India, but it's really bad to see a similar behavior of Indian people in US. They are still living in a mental world where disable kids were murdered. Even people like Satya Nadella's wife has to go through similar challenges with their disable kids. I am talking of good earning people, the houses in my community are around 2.5-3 Million in range.I am not sure whether this is a Seattle freeze or I would face same situation anywhere else.

TD,liDh63,I wish I were never born,"Please don't troll. I am at the edge. Please.I feel like quitting now. I don't even know where to start, unfortunately, but will give it a try. I'm unable to think straight.I always associated myself with my career (not the money). I went to one of top universities and did well there. Joined management consulting after school. My career was going great and as planned, progressing and moving up, best ratings every year. I moved to Canada to get international exposure in same company. The leadership was new (and later realized incompetent) here. When they couldn't bring enough business for 2 years, they laid off many employees including me due to shortage of work. This changed everything in my life. I went into depression, was living on anti-depressants and things didn't change even after therapy. I lost my self-confidence and till date, could never regain it. I still have doubts on my capabilities and felt imposter syndrome was real. I have hard time thinking straight/structured (which was my strength in consulting). I applied for roles, but Canadian banks/companies always lowballed me knowing I was immigrant and didn't have professional network (which was true). I tried a lot but when I couldn't get anything, I accepted junior roles. I had to pay bills, support family. This decision literally wrote-off 8 years of my career and experience. 5 years down the line, I still struggle. I fear more from the word ""interview"" than a nuclear war. I believe I am not good at interviewing and selling myself. In these 5 years, I have been constantly rated ""exceptional"" but no promotion. I have been shown false promises for promotion, but never given a promotion. I am not good at politics in office. When I apply outside, people are reluctant to give me promotion, rather some (who are now my network) even dare to ask me to join at even more junior level (I wonder how shamelessly can they ask). Some in my so-called network are reluctant to refer me for promotion level roles, though they are okay referring me to lateral moves outside my company. I tried to look good in things, having a family, but when I have been trained since childhood that ""a successful person is the one who excels/gets promoted in career"", I am unable to get out of it. And since, I am unable to, I feel like quitting. And unfortunately, I am unable to do that because then my kids face come into my eyes. I can't think good of myself anymore. I can't live or die and am hanging in the middle, go to bed every night praying I don't get up the next morning. And now it feels even God is not with me, I even started losing faith in God. I used to go to gym to let go off my stress, but now I have lost hope and stopped going there.I don't deny that there are way less fortunate people than me, but I really don't know what do I do now?

Note - I thought the same about my parents when they were retiring.

I am an immigrant with not so supportive family. I have seen layoffs, switched jobs twice and currently working in a job that I am not so happy about, with okaish pay and under a micromanager. I have been facing mental health issues due to family mainly and in the last few years have been seeing a therapist. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD/ADD which finally makes sense as to how I feel. It has been hard for me. Considering the market downtrend and fear of layoffs everywhere, my stress levels have only shot up making it hard to focus on work or personal well-being.

P&G,babyodadad,Is this a sign that my MIL was an abusive narcissist?,"My wife has this thing where she most definitely has to please her mother, even if my MIL isn’t necessarily making a request. I’ve noticed over the last several years of our marriage, as I got more and more intertwined with her mom, that my MIL would often make a general statement about something, and that would immediately impact my wife’s thinking on that subject.A few examples:MIL once said that kids should be going to daycare no matter what the age. She didn’t say we should send our kids there. But soon as MIL said it, my wife reverted from our previous agreement that we won’t send our kids to daycare until they are at least 4 years old.Then one time my MIL asked when were we planning to come for Christmas dinner. She also mentioned that she was taking off a day before to go do groceries and immediately my wife started demanding we go to their house right away instead of us going there on the time we planned to go.Last but not least, we always had plans to move to Texas and we started researching the DFW area. After a couple of trips we thought it would be much better to raise our kids there instead of the colder northeast. Turns out my MIL got wind, and she immediately started expressing (subtlety, as she always does) about how TX is such an awful place. “But you guys do as you want to, it’s your life not mine and I love you either way!” She said. Immediately after my wife changed her mind about moving to TX and we had a big fight. Several more examples exist but I can’t list them all.MIL has said (when drunk) that she used to be very harsh on my wife and also my wife once (when we were dating in college ages ago) mentioned getting a beating when young. I’ve never inquired about it because I love her and don’t wanna bring up any dirty past memories.But I do seriously think there’s some power dynamic at play here.

New,helpwelp,Self-imposing parents,"TLDR: Been with my now spouse since grad school. We fell in love, had a perfect life until his parents moved here right before our wedding. I’m done, feeling suicidal and no hopes for the future.I lived with my fiancé and in-laws for 2 months before the wedding (since my lease ended earlier), and I realised that not the kind of toxic life I want forever. Told my fiancé about this whole situation, pointed out specific issues and he communicated those with his parents. There came all the drama, crying, “is this what we brought you up for” etc. We both went quiet.I went to my home country for the wedding and let my mother know I can’t live with this and asked her to cancel the wedding. She was too scared of the society “what will people think!” and asked my spouse to promise her that he will take care of me. Topic ended right there.In the last 3 years, I’ve experienced mental trauma so many times from them, and without any specific details - it’s just tough for them to understand my POV. Im doing very well in career and they are never happy for me. I see a hint of jealousy whenever I mention a promotion or something good in my career. Their expectation is to treat their son (and them) like a child, serve him food, cut him fruits, ask them for water etc.I was brought up by a single mother to be independent, so I don’t really understand this whole servitude mentality. My spouse understands and he too wants equality in our relationship. and he expressed his desire to not live together with them several times. That just begins another drama “we moved here to live with you and will only leave when we die”. My MIL is an expert emotional manipulator. She does behave nicer when around other people, but as soon as I’m alone with her, she makes hateful comments and faces.I feel done, have thought of suicide and divorce (that will help me finally cut off ties with in-laws). Spouse loves me and says he will choose me before the parents any day. I’m pregnant and scared for the future. Do not want my kid to grow up with this.Apart from getting a therapist (who probably would not understand why parents live with us), what do I do? #burnout #mentalhealth",,8/8/2022,111,1994,16,Indians Issue,Burnout

Coupang,Do@IT,Free Will vs karma/Prarabdh,"Was having a debate on the topic, so though to get some more views. It turns out that most of the things we do are already predistined and there no free will. We seem to be born in a particular family, have a set mind and body and just act according to His will.If thats the case then why do anything, as w'll do it anyway, why put the effort. Well we can't choose to do nothing as well, our mind will not allow us to sit idea if His Will is for us to perform.All those who say that make your own destiny have no idea that even the desire and thoughs one gets are all programmed.Its similar to a cow who is tied to a pole. While cow can rome within the perimeter of the pole and think its exercising the free will. But the fact is her circumstances like the pole, the length and strength of the role etc are all pre determined. There is nothing much it can do here. Same way we humans are ordined to solve our purpose and what is deemed to happen will happen nonetheless. Like our education, job, spouse, kids, death, everything else is inconsequential. Continue to do your deeds and don't worry about the outcome as we never controle the output.What have your experiences been or ways of thinking?What happens when we die? How did we arrive on Earth?Do you believe in Luck? Does your Karma define your luck?

Cisco,Dfjg50,I think I understand finally why I want to get into Google so badly.,"I did a lot of crazy shit in School. Both I and my parents were equally surprised that I managed to get a High School degree. I badly fucked up and got into a tier 3 college. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with that college. It was actually quite prestigious. A little bit overpriced, but one of the best schools in that region.But every moment I spent in that college reminded me of all the stupid shit I did in school. Somehow I felt humiliated being there. I was afraid that people would find out about what I did in school. That school felt like a punishment to me.I wanted to crack GATE and get an M.Tech from an IIT. I felt I wasted my parent's money by going to a tier 3 private university instead of a Govt college which would have been significantly cheaper. I felt undeserving of all the opportunities my parents provided to me. Given that my school GPA was fucked up, I didn't care about my college GPA too. In 8th semester of that program, I realized that GATE is out of my reach. So I wrote GRE and managed to get a 322 in it. Enough to get me into a decent college in America for my master's. I didn't do the master's because I was interested in the subject. I wanted to get a 100K+ job in America so people won't judge me based on the stupid shit I did in school. I never took any of the assignments or coursework seriously. I managed to get two jobs by the third semester of the program a 100K job and a 140K job.5 years down the lane, I feel like people will still judge me based on my past.Today I want to get into Google, because if I get into Google I think:1. People will not think of me as an Idiot.2. People will give me opportunities even though I attended a tier 3 college in the past.3. I would feel safe. I would feel like I can say that I have turned my life around. I would feel that people would look beyond all the dumb stupid shit I have done in my life.4. If I can get into Google, I can stop running away from my past finally.As irritational and non-sensical as it may sound.

This is ruining my life.Talked to my therapist and she believes it is just me being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things stressing me out. And guess what? My life is (or was!) good, and the stupid as*hat that I am turn it to hell for myself and everyone around me.For example, my stupid colleague says something annoying? I’ll just be pissed off, down or grumpy the whole day and ruin my own mood as well as anyone else’s that I may interact with. Another example, I’m at a party and there’s a friend invited that I’m not a big fan of? I am not even physically able to hide I despise them… It’ll make everything awkward for myself and everyone around. Work-related deadline? Let me tint every second of my life with excruciating stress and be in a state of guilt, grumpiness and despair.The problem seems to be that I cannot simply let go and focus on the “good” instead of the annoying or stressful things in my life. This is literally killing me… I really do not want to continue living like this. I’ve hurt people dear to me, I’ve tried to be better but no avail.

Amazon,memeJam,Confused,I’m an SDE 2 and I work in a team where everyone is smarter and more experienced than me. I feel like my team members are never satisfied with my work. People in my team assume that I should know a lot of stuff. Doesn’t everyone need to start somewhere. I feel I’ve let down my team even after putting a lot of effort. I’m pretty sure nobody respects me in the team. It would be great if they can simply tell it out plain and simple. I’m not good at reading between the lines or taking cues. With every passing day I’m losing confidence in me. I feel like I don’t belong here.

Honestly, although I’ve landed good roles, I don’t think I’m good at my job nor have I ever been.I would like to spend my time MAKING stuff. Using my hands.

Could be interesting and important work (at least better than slinging meaningless software). Finish work, that’s the end of the day. Simpler life. Or if in renewables, a project management sort of role.My income would decrease A LOT, worth it? I think probably 60-70% less. Just a guess.Am I delusional that this would be more fun than the corporate miserable shit show? Is a more “physical” job actually crap and should I count my blessings for the WFH warm & cozy office?

Financial Service Company,bfDl20,Inappropriate jokes,"I have to ask you about a scenario I experienced, for context it was 2 people in the situation, 1 person was from a different department (the other was my employee). Without all context the place I work it is generally toxic and I was giving praise to Person A (not in our department, because it’s deserved and they do a good job). Person B who reports to me makes a ‘joke’ (passive aggressive comment), ‘he is buttering you up, don’t let them buy you shots to Person A’ (Person A ignored it and I wish I questioned in the moment). I interpreted it as:A). Person B is implying I would take advantage/assault (?) Person AB). Person B is implying some passive aggressive view on my orientation (well beyond any professional boundary).Person B has a history of being crude (ie I heard from other people, and he referred to his own disabled brother as ‘retarded’.This is awkward for me as I can’t see how else to interpret what he thinks as a ‘joke’. Nothing is ever funny about assault/taking advantage through substances or otherwise and sexual orientation (I’m straight), is in the same category of gender, religion, race, etc. and one should not associate that with assault.My question:How should I or could I respond?I want to address the individual directly and say something to the effect ‘I understand you might be joking but its a personal boundary for me to joke about assault or implying I would make someone drunk to take advantage of them because thats how I interpreted it’. Or should I be even more direct ‘I don’t think ‘be careful don’t let him buy you shots’ is professional, so warning you not to repeat that as to me it implies some form of assault’.Am I overthinking?

Sam's Club,gay_,"Gay indian, need help","Hi, so I am gay. I came to the US for a Masters and now I work here. I have always been ashamed of being gay and I had always planned to marry a girl eventually. However, when the time came and my parents set up an arranged marriage for me I told her a few months before our engagement and we broke it off. It wasn't pretty but wasn't too ugly either.I had only ever had casual relationships with men because the plan was to eventually get married. But after this incident, I met someone last year. And things have been good with him. We have fights and issues, mostly because of our cultural and personality differences but most days its nice, very nice.I came out to my mom and she said she loved me but I need to choose the right path and give all this up. I gave her time and answered all her questions. It's been 2 years. She still thinks it's a choice and wants me to go back to India. She thinks that I have lost my path and am being duped by bad people. She cries most days, has migraines and difficulty sleeping. Every now and then a relative calls her and tells her that she is not a good parent. I am 31 and single.My sister understands. She is the only one who wants to know how my real life is going. She is the only one I actually share my life details with. She admitted that although she wishes things were different but she can see that I am happy and wants me to stay in the US.My dad doesn't know. He is the most conservative and the most sensitive. He wouldn't even accept a girl from a different religion let alone a guy. He told me this himself. He has also had multiple surgeries. My mom begged me to not tell him anything in case his health deteriorates. And I haven't.This is not a post to vent I actually need help. I went to two different therapists. They tell me that I am in a difficult position. that I need to be honest bla bla bla as if I don't know those things already.I don't want to ruin a girl's life. But I see my parents humiliated every day. And I am the cause of that humiliation. I see them sad every time I call and I am the cause of that sadness.My mom was my whole world. I don't think I have loved anyone the way I love her. But I find myself dreading her calls nowadays. I find ways to ignore the calls and shorten our conversations. I am scared and frustrated. Of course my boyfriend sees this and it has an effect on him.Every time we have a fight, I feel like I will lose both my family and my boyfriend. My plan always was to get enough work experience and money and go back to India to settle down. I love India and the US. My mom tries to keep reminding me about how I am going back on my original plan. How I have started hating my culture. But I don't hate my country. I just think I am fortunate to get a chance to live a respectable life with a guy here and I really wanna try.But I see the sadness and public humiliation of my family every other day and it's like slow poison. I can barely work or enjoy anything at all.Update: I wanted to share an update on this. My boyfriend of 1.3 years finally broke up with me. His reasoning was that he feels hidden as he is not accepted by my family. I do video calls with my family every day and he cannot be a part of those. He wants my family to acknowledge that he is a part of my life. I asked him that if he wants I can come out to my dad but I still cannot guarantee mine and his acceptance. He was not okay with this. Anyway we are trying to remain friends. But I am now in a new dilemma about what to do with my life. Currently my entire life revolves around him.Update: I wanted to share an update about my life. My boyfriend broke up with me after 1.5 years because he is not okay with the fact that my parents don't accept him. That I talk to my parents in a language he doesn't understand on video calls that he is not a part of. I love him and he loves me. But he is also not okay with me going away to India every year to meet my family when he cannot visit them.Update on my family: My sister is very accepting. She even spoke with my boyfriend multiple times over video calls. My mom doesn't speak English, yet she agreed to talk to my ex once on video call when my dad wasn't around. She barely said hi, how are you. She said she will try to visit us before she knew about our breakup. As for my dad, within a span of one year, he has gone from finding girls of same caste to saying that I can take as much time as I need, he will take care of the relatives.Update on me: I am dealing with the trauma of being dumped by the first love of my life right when we were thinking about marriage. I know he loves me but he has his own issues. I don't really know what I to do next. I absolutely loved having a partner. There is a part of me that wants to look for an Indian gay guy. Another part of me thinks all gay relationships are doomed to fail and I should find a woman who will agree to be with me even after knowing my truth. I am not going to lie to my partner. Right now I am just in therapy and focusing on work.#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #lgbt #gay #queer",,5/8/2022,173,5951,82,Indians Issue,Burnout

However the guilt builds and then I do a small amount of work and then repeat the process.Nobody complains about this to me, I have not gotten into trouble because I am still ""productive"" in a sense.I feel bad, just like an obese person would feel bad about eating a tub of ice-cream, but they do it anyway.If I was to blame part of it, is that I am remote and not in an office, so I don't feel accountable and can just play games without anyone disciplining me.Needless to say, this guilt has built up and the apathy which makes me despondent about work, but I am not burned out. If someone kicked my door in and said I need to design a new micro-service and pointed a gun at me I would get that service built in no time, because my mental energy and drive hasn't gone, its just not being channelled into something productive.Anyone feel the same, how do you get out of it?Perhaps I need to get into an office...remote working isn't sustainable, at least for me...#mentalhealth #burnout",,11/25/2022,26,1072,5,Indians Issue,Stress

Google,oaDh23,My mental health journey,"Warning: Long post with no tldrGoals:- Let people in similar situations (OCD, PTSD, Depression, Anxiety) know they’re not alone- Get feedback from people who have improved in similar situationsI’ve always been depressed. I remember being unhappy at even 5 years old. My father was an angry tyrant that beat me anytime I expressed myself or spoke, he would do the same for my brothers and my mom. He would bully me and everyone around him because he felt insecure. I spent most of my childhood in silence. I had no parenting, no emotional skills training, and no social skills training. My only creative outlet was making fun of other people, not a cool thing to do but an art form myself and other insecure kids practiced. My only pleasurable outlet in childhood was food, so I ate too much and was fat. I have always been angry and irritable. Years later, I realize that I have PTSD from childhood because I could be beaten at anytime for anything, and emotionally abused constantly for no reason.My mother had a life-changing stroke when I was 11. She had weak capillaries in the brain due to a birth defect of my grandmother smoking during pregnancy, a normal things in the ‘40s. My mother was paralyzed on most of her left side. Amazingly, through lots of physical therapy she could manage to walk and still hold a job. She had a major stroke every few years afterwards and had to relearn how to walk and talk again. She was a strong woman, but not strong enough to stand up to my dad and do the smart thing of leaving him. The whole time throughout her struggle my father yelled at her, threatened to beat her, and actually did beat her a few times. Screaming was a normal thing in my household. Eventually by 20, my mother was in a nursing home and a shell of her former self. The meds they gave her took away her spark and made her seem like a ghost of her former self. She died when I was 22. I never told her I loved her because I was afraid to be vulnerable, I treated her poorly (Verbal only) because I was copying my father.In high school, I started talking with bad kids because that’s the only people that would talk to me. I was expelled for drugs and had to go to military school. Getting away from my parents and getting parenting vicariously through other kids was one of the happiest points of my life. The structure allowed me to exceed. Military school was better than my home life, go figure. The brainwashing aspects of it took a few years to wear off, and the discipline remained.The hazy cloudy feeling of depression kicked in for me at around 21. I couldn’t concentrate or remember things well. My appetite was enormous and I gained a lot of weight.I beat the heck out of my body to get through grad school. I went FT grad school and FT work at the same time. It was very hard. I had dreams every night of unsolvable problems and being forced to make decisions. I would get stuck in loops in my dreams for hours every night, where I couldn’t make a decision. This lasted for all of grad school and up to about 6 months afterwards. I started developing OCD symptoms of double checking that I’d locked the door.I had no real friends until about 24. I would subconsciously push people away because everyone that was supposed to love me either beat me or died. Once I started developing social skills, it was great. I had actual tools to improve my situation. I made my first real set of friends, all of which I still talk to now. My experiences on X and Acid gave me deep introspection into how to love and why to love.In mid-twenties, I had enough of corporate life and the medium-sized city I moved into for college. Decided to sell everything I own, get in my car, and travel the USA. By this point I had some OCD symptoms of not touching door handles without a paper towel.Arrived in SF back then and the energy was electric! People were actually cool and interesting back then. Nobody was in a hurry or just talking to you because they wanted something from you. Was vibing with some of the coolest people I’ve ever met. Made some good friends for partying.Had a few one night stands up to that point, but never a relationship. Met a cool German girl but friend-zoned myself with lack of game. Hung out with her everyday for 6 months. Signals were obvious sometimes and could have made moves on multiple occasions, just didn’t know how to. She was a therapist, and we talked about a lot of our issues. I started taking meds (Meds made me happy and gave me lots of energy, but felt artificial). OCD symptoms of double checking doors and not touching door handles went away.She went back to Europe, I was depressed. I traveled for a few months around the world. Came back and hung out with my party friends. Took 6 months off to walk around SF, chill, and lose weight. Got in good shape. Met my first actual girlfriend and started my first six-figure job. Life was good.Worked hard for 2 years to save up money to travel the world. Dumped my ex, poor girl, still talk to her now. Traveled the world for over a year. Learned a lot about myself, saw beautiful things, learned about cultures, lost weight, and dated widely. Weened off meds towards the end and life got tougher. More irritable, more tired, and found myself not making eye contact with others. Also, OCD symptoms of double checking doors and not touching door handles returned.I was now in my 30s and off meds back in SF. My 2nd girlfriend ever, had traveled with me on the trip around the world and was living with me in SF. My company was full of incompetent people and I told myself I wanted to work with the best. I wanted to work at Google. I did interviews at Facebook for practice and failed miserably. My skills were lacking and I wasn’t saying the things I needed to say. I spent the next 4 years spending all of my waking time to get into Google. I studied everything and interviewed everywhere. I faced doubt and rejection constantly. I was fired from my job with incompetent people for telling my director that I didn’t want to work on a project they wanted me on because it wasn’t a worthwhile project and something I already built for the same problem was far superior. I dumped my 2nd gf soon after because we were fighting a lot and I didn’t want to get married (She was on a tourist visa and can only stay if married).By this point I’m full blown anxious, have a panic attack about once a year. After a panic attack, the fear of another panic attack is debilitating for the next month or so. Power through it, or so I think.I worked the next 2 years unpaid studying in a library to get into Google. I immersed myself in some of the hardest theory and coding in the world. I met my 3rd girlfriend and she would listen to my problems, we had a lot of good times too. I had a self-made curriculum that I wanted to complete before interviewing.I developed urinary problems from stress acting out on the bladder. I’m peeing 20+ times a day by this point and know that I’m pushing myself too hard, but continue anyway. I’m having anxiety loop dreams every night.I realize all of my former party friends aren’t good people. They’re either addicts or haters. I give them 2nd chances a few times and end up disappointed. One of them dies from an overdose, feel sorry and angry at him at the same time. No local friends at this point because my friend bar is too high.I finished my self-made curriculum, by this point I’m 3 years into studying to get into Google with nothing to show for it. After the curriculum I interviewed everywhere, and failed often. Still, I learned more here and there and sharpened my skills. I interviewed at about 25 companies at the same time. At least 2 phone screens a day and 1 onsite a week (No phone screens that day). Got offers from a 2nd tier and a cushy government job.Work the 2nd tier job, people seem much more competent then what I’m used to. Pay is good. Proud to be part of something good. On the flip side, realize I have poor stakeholder skills and my boss isn’t helping me whatsoever with scope, visibility, or push back. A few weeks into the job and I’m working 80 hour weeks. I have no problem with that. I have a big panic attack where I literally have to hold my mouth shut to avoid screaming in an open office, muster the strength after a few minutes to get out of the building. Take the next day and a half off. I’m working hard for 3 months straight and I see a random meeting invite with HR one day. I suck it up and show up. They have nothing on me and are fishing with random innocent things that they say are misconduct to see if I’ll bite and say something I shouldn’t. My boss doesn’t stand up for me and lies about meetings with him to push back (Says we didn’t have them when we did). HR lady asks me some personal questions about my urinary symptoms, I’m too burnt out by this point to tell them to fudge off for their invasive questions. They send me home for the week. They call me to fire me and with no just cause the HR lady falsely calls me a liar and say I lied about something (I didn’t). I call a lawyer and negotiate twice the severance because they asked me ridiculous personal questions and falsely called me a liar.I interview wildly again. Get an offer from a non-tier tech company. Nothing else going, I’ll take it. Seems easy. Everything is great for awhile. They hire a boss for me who is incompetent, she has never written a line of code in her life and knows no theory. What is she doing here? She micromanages me so she can take credit for my good work and make all bad work seem like it’s mine. She wants me to build terrible ideas she has and I pushback telling her why they won’t work. Voice my concern to my skip. He does nothing but sit in on a few meetings to cover himself. Get fired. Negotiate a better severance.By this point, it’s Covid, I’m interviewing at Google for the 3rd time, and my 3rd girlfriend ever is starting problems. I realize that most of my issues with past girlfriends are founded in them having to put up with me. I develop a phobia of heights and am worried that I’m going to jump if I go up to high heights. These are where intrusive thoughts start to really suck. Feel claustrophobic and trapped in situations I can’t avoid like heights or crowds.My 3rd ex wants to get married before her visa runs out. By this point, we’ve been dating for 3 years. She has been hanging out with me much less because she’s helping her single mother sister with her baby while there is no daycare during covid. I’m okay with the idea so long as prenup covers me, she is comfortable moving somewhere else if I get a job there, and she agrees to babysit less once daycares are open. Prenup lawyer says I’d have to pay her $50k per year of marriage in alimony or else judge will throw prenup out, and that she could fight me indefinitely in a divorce with a prenup and the lawyers would get everything I owned. Ex tries to negotiate the prenup with me with no leverage, says she doesn’t want to move, and says she wants to keep babysitting. Signs are clear that she needs to be dumped. Dump her.Now it’s covid, I’m still interviewing at Google, and I have no local friends or girlfriend. I move a few hours away to be near a childhood friend to have someone to hang out with.I get an offer from Google and am ecstatic!! I crushed it and begin to feel that the hard work paid off. My childhood friend is cool at first. I try to get back into the dating world but I’m anxious and fat, still fighting every step of the way.Start working at Google, get thrown into the fire right away. Have projects due on my 2nd week. No time for Tech Immersion fun that everyone else is doing. Working non-stop. I’m on one of Google’s few poor WLB teams and hate it. I power through to get to my year anniversary to switch teams. My boss throws me under the bus for not being able to manage the work of 10 people by myself. I’m having frequent panic attacks, I’m getting new phobias that I’m going to message a random coworker bad words in order to get fired. I’m getting panic from being near my home office. My former childhood friend I’m living near is insecure about how I worked hard my whole life and achieved things, and is trying to put me down in front of his friends, sever all ties. I’m not saying the last bit to cover my own insecurity, that’s what actually happened.I go on disability. The time off improves my anxiety and appetite. I find a therapist and shrink that are actually good, and there guidance seems to help. I’ve been seeing them since.I go back to work and immediately start looking for a new team. Interview for 10 teams, get 3 offers.Join a new team. Actual Google WLB, interesting product, and decent boss. Work hard to become a solid member of team. Develop the stakeholder skills I was lacking. Anxiety is still there and I find myself overworking. I last on the team and it seems that my coworkers respect me. Still, I’m developing new OCD phobias (Tall bridges, rivers, being in Google offices).Eventually, have so many OCD phobias that I can’t hang. I try to relax but everything is a challenge for me to overwork myself, even on travel. Doing nothing bothers me, the PTSD keeps me hypervigilent.Gets so bad, that I get 3 new OCD phobias in the same day (Rural areas, the dark, and fog). Realize that it’s time to slow down. Go back on short-term disability. Love my team and hate that I can’t do work, but need time to heal and fix myself. Now worried if my OCD and PTSD will improve. Realized that I pushed myself too hard and should have slowed down. Was trying my best. Think I can power through this.UPDATE 1Realize that my anxiety is founded in not wanting to feel alone, and my brain distracts itself with phobias and hypervigilence when I’m alone too much. Basically, my brain goes into fight-or-flight mode to avoid the same type of loneliness I felt as a child.Focus now is on making friends, dating, and reducing stress.UPDATE 2Found a great gf, that’s very supportive. Found a stable place to live. Started taking meds, and they are very helpful.Was doing good for a bit, then overdid it one day and was near panic. This made me agoraphobic and unwanting to leave my house. The underlying fear is having a panic attack in public and feeling like I’ll lose control.Working now on leaving my home a few times a day for exposure therapy. Got up to an hour outside my home yesterday : )UPDATE 3Anti-depressants feel like their working, intrusive thoughts are less sticky. I carry anti-anxiety meds too, good to have in case I’m near panic. Walking outside my home for 3 hours a day now. Looking for a new therapist that specializes in Exposure Therapy to help get me out of the house and beat my other phobias. GF is still very supportive.UPDATE 4Anti-depressants working well. Exercise and staying out of the house as much as possible is doing a great job for the anxiety! Pushing the boundaries of my exposure everyday. Walking towards feared object 1/4 way, 1/2 way, 3/4 way, etc. Standing next to feared objects for 30 minutes is great. Telling myself that “I’ve gotta do what I gotta do” and that “I won’t be bullied by Anxiety” is working too. Socializing gets me out if my own head. GF dumped me, my anxiety may have been too much to handle, her loss.UPDATE 5Did a lot of exposure during last few days while I miss ex-gf. Very anxious after the exposure, trying not to overdo it. Trying not to stay at home or in my head to long, will allow ruminating. Found that talking with others about things unrelated to my mental health is great for not ruminating.UPDATE 6Currently a month into an Intensive OCD program. Seems to be working. They are teaching me all kinds of tools to handle my OCD, and are giving me a great set of exposures to attack my core fears.UPDATE 72 months into Intensive OCD program, symptoms have dropped drastically. Know how to handle things better now without panicking. Starting to get real sleep too.UPDATE 84 months into Intensive OCD program, 95% of symptoms gone. Don’t get close to panic very often. Some things are still tough. Sleeping a lot better.

Parenthood (2 kids, 5 and 1 year old), work and lack of time for oneself and each other after chores are the main stressors.No family nearby. Virtually no friends. Everyone is busy and I think we are not that interesting or useful to stay in touch with anyway. A sibling lives on the other coast but has 3 small kids, they are overwhelmed too. Our parents are not in top shape physically, grandma just had a serious accident, grandpa is near diabetic. Other set of grandparents are overseas, do not speak English.Spouse stays up late. Bad sleep hygiene. Says the thoughts are constantly racing and watching some TV can bring the relief that is needed. Does not like exercise, and cannot meditate. Suspects adult ADHD. Spouse works in medicine, does not want to seek help however. Does not want to be branded crazy and does not believe doctors could help anyway. Also struggles with some back pain and exhaustion. Impatient with the kids, yells very often seems on the brink of turning physical with themI am also struggling, but I manage to fit in some walks and jogs (the latter late evenings after kids are asleep the walks are with the kids.) I try to do 15 min of yoga/meditation/abs a few times a week as well. I wish I had time for more, but chores, child rearing and work do not let me.I often stay up late with my spouse, but I try to limit it and fight this. However, pretty much that is the only way to spend time together it seems. I have afternoon naps sometimes to make up for sleep lost at night.I also lose my patience with the kids on occasion, but much less. I am the favored parent.I am worried about my spouse. Appears to be on the brink of nervous breakdown. What can I do? Does not want to seek medical help, and my suggestions of better sleep, exercise and meditation are rejected as unimplementable.

Hanging out with work friends is fun but I kept thinking how it's only work friends and all the conflicts of interest that can happen. I briefly opened up to a school friend a year ago, didn't want to come off as too direct so I told them some of the more triggering events as a joke, and they just laughed and brushed it off as if I was really telling a joke.Today is Valentine's day and my family is asking me to start messaging people they want me to meet and date. I don't want to talk to any of them, I just want to be with myself in peace.Being in the closet probably contributed to a lot of stress here, but I don't think I'm ready for the gay dating scene either.

Covid lockdowns were so hard on me in 20/21. I was just starting my IT career then and I feel like the lockdowns made focusing on my career impossible. Back then I was a field service tech going to retail stores and doing IT work. Then in 2021 I was recovering financially from being in a lot of debt from covid, being a victim of several car break ins in Oakland, and also having to sublease my apartment lease due to crime. It didn't help that my parents weren't willing to use my new name and pronouns when I lived with them in 20/21. Then in 2022 I managed to get my first full time contract, and financially things were largely stable until my roommates didn't want to renew the apartment lease after 6 months. Then I find another room and things continue getting better financially. Socially because of all the stress I feel like it's really hard for me to socialize or come up with things to talk about in social situations.

This is so unhealthy and I am starting to burn out.For some twisted reason I feel like a lot of this is driven by what I am being paid vs what I feel I am worth to the company. I feel like if I get paid more all these problems will go away. Am I crazy to think this? It’s not like the workload is going to reduce but maybe I’ll be motivated to work harder? Or am I better of setting boundaries and taking less money to tell my boss I want to hire more people to my team?

And people always give advice of 'go to meetups, volunteer...' but the truth is some of us do have support systems but our bringing up made reaching out for help so hard...I've gone on friend dates, I have people I can call 'friends', yet when times are low, I cannot reach out to anyone..yes I'm working on this in therapy but I don't know if I'll ever be normal.So two things:1) To all those suffering alone , without a healthy family or a friend circle to be vulnerable with - sending you all good vibes.

Microsoft,Sob story,Parents don’t care for me anymore 😢,"I am having a very tough time facing the phase of life I’m in . Let me start by saying that I come from an Indian family .Parents started to pressurize me since my undergrad to get married and especially mom - was forcing/ gaslighting me whenever she brought in a potential groom and I didn’t like him for whatever reason .I couldn’t take the pressure and would at times break down at work , back in India . At times when I would cry in front of her - she would start crying too - and create an emotional scene in front of my dad and elder brother saying I don’t value her efforts and I am an arrogant child .Everyone would end up sympathizing her .Once I came to the US , parents waited until I finished my masters and immediately resumed the same emotional blackmail . I eventually gave in and married my husband- who tbh I think is fairly good looking and came across as a gentleman . However post marriage - my parents started to become totally emotionally unavailable to me . Husband and his family started to take advantage of this and mock me and push me to further lows - husband is physically with me in the US but seems very inclined to arrange new stuff or plan for home improvements back in India for mother sister and family but ignores me and my emotional needs .I feel like an island 🏝 and am also very much exhausted and drained 🥺If I mention my issues with parents they either gaslight me saying that’s non existent or stop calling me for a while until I don’t bring up any issuesI need help 😔",,5/31/2022,138,3801,32,Indians Issue,Others

After close to 15 years of focused high intensity work I was burned out mentally and physically (started having hormonal issues, hypertension, etc). I resigned last spring because I couldn't take it anymore.Took me 6 months of vacation (intertwined with medical therapy) to start to feel normal. I wanted to work again.Started applying to jobs in October and got a reality check. So far I went through the loops with 10 companies. 4 FAANG-level companies cancelled interviews due to hiring freezes/layoffs. 3 rejected (I thought I did well in 2 of those, but alas).

At the height, it was 2400mg Advil/ per day and 3 days off per month. Doctors diagnosed with endometriosis and adenomyosis. I had two surgeries to address that but nothing helped completely.

LinkedIn,kjthnk,Wife's parents controlling our marriage,"I got married last year and I have a good understanding of my wife. We both love each other. Sometimes we have arguments on silly things. She's too sensitive and she cries immediately. My wife is a nice person, but she is absent-minded sometimes. I never had a problem with that. I never wanted her to work hard. I take almost all the household responsibilities. I wanted her to do a job(her current job is chill) without much pressure. But she wanted a better job. I was always supportive of that. I helped her get started with leetcode, design, etc. But she is in her comfort zone and she doesn't study.. after failing a few interviews, she was sad. Her parents always compare her with others. She comes to me with a sad face and says that her parents have big expectations of her and she is not making them happy. I ask her not to take those comparisons seriously.Once we had an argument on a minor issue and we called her parents, I explained the issue and told them that she is absent-minded sometimes. Instead of convincing both of us(they could have said she will get better and I shouldn't take those issues seriously), they bashed me saying it was my mistake. They said even if she does mistakes throughout her life I shouldn't say anything. That issue became big and they came to The US within a month. My wife and I were very happy until they came to our home. They started some arguments out of nowhere and started blaming me for everything. I am the kind of guy who doesn't take the blame if there is no mistake on my end. I defended myself on every blame and those arguments continued. According to them, I should take every blame from them even if there is no mistake.After the issue went to our parents, my parents asked me not to argue with them as they wanted our marriage to stay and I was taking all the blame from her parents. Since that day, I was sad as I couldn't defend myself and my wife understood it and started telling her parents to stop everything and go to India. Her parents couldn't take it as my wife is getting closer to me and they are portrayed negatively. According to them, my wife has to prioritize her parents first even after getting 100 years. They are indirectly saying that she shouldn't love me more.Now they took my wife away from me even though there was no issue between us. Not sure if they are looking for a divorce. I like my wife and she likes me. But she blindly believes in her parents. She wouldn't say no to her parents. She tried convincing them, but they said she is believing me blindly and her life will be hell if she stays with me. They stopped sending my wife to my bedroom when the argument started and gradually I didn't get a chance to talk to her privately. I pleaded with them that I am feeling lonely and I want to talk to her. But they were stubborn. They went out to some relative's place and are not coming back. Now I can't even talk to her on phone.

Tesla,umadbro,Dealing with toxic coworkers,I have a couple of co-workers that are junior in level to me. they've set their mission to ruin my reputation.

Bloomberg,noRtoPlz,ADHD and RTO are slowly ruining me,"Just for context of severity… I am clinically diagnosed with ADHD and am prescribed the highest dosage of stimulant medication for treatment as a <110 lb woman. I wasn’t diagnosed until end of high school, went from failing school, depressed, socially isolated and bullied to a straight A student, graduated magna cum laude at a good college, and have been your classic case of perfectionist workaholic to (over)compensate for 18 years of identifying as an inferior, outcasted failure.Got a 12% raise my first year after only being on my (new) team for 6 months for exceeding expectations and exceptional work. I was told there was “plenty of room for growth if I keep up the good work.” Which I have. Except then my company started requiring 3 day RTO and there’s been friction with my managers ever since…My medication treats my ADHD as it’s meant to. It helps me focus and stay on task. It doesn’t treat the insomnia side effect. Working from home, I could roll out of bed and start working at 8am. Now I have an hour and 15 minute commute. Now I have to wake up at 5:45am if I want to be presentable and make it to the office at 8am (it never happens). We have an “agreement” for me to have flexible working hours, but even this is hard for me. What about when I can’t get to sleep until 3am? Am I supposed to still wake up at 7-8am to get to the office by 9-10:30am? With only 4-5 hours of sleep? Driving for over an hour on the highway and endangering everyone and myself? That is not where they’re flexible. The 3 day in office policy is strictly enforced. If I’ve already taken or planned my days, on these days where I don’t sleep, I don’t get this flexibility and I can feel this waring on me mentally and physically…But they get frustrated with me. Because they “already give me so much flexibility with my hours.” And because they “have other people to manage and this makes it more difficult to manage and makes it unfair to others who have to adhere to this policy.”But those people don’t have ADHD! Or insomnia with over an hour commute! And I can’t live like this anymore. It’s another morning where I’m supposed to go into the office but I’ve only slept for 4 hours and I’m sick to my stomach anxious about driving, and I already took a sick day Friday and I can’t deal with the judgement and frustration from my manager.

General Motors,sk04jb,Sister has fights with parents constantly,"Mentally I'm drained. I don't even want to think about it but it's always on my mind because these fights happen multiple times a week. I can't take it. I don't have anyone to vent to so please let me post here.Before COVID, my family used to get along moderately well. There may be some little squabble here and there but it was forgotten shortly after. Things started to change when my sister got a long distance boyfriend (who lives in China). My sister wants to move to China to be with her boyfriend and of course, the entire family thinks that's bad idea for obvious reasons. My parents oppose it 100% and will not let her go no matter way. This is the main source of contention.At the beginning, there were just minor arguments about it, but slowly snowballed into heated shouting matches. Even things completely unrelated to her desire to move to China now get mixed in these arguments. One can say that the scope of these arguments ballooned. I can literally feel the resentment my sister holds for my parents now. Even unrelated and trivial things now build up resentment and can turn into shouting matches. In the past, little disagreements just were forgotten shortly after.My parents are immigrants, and so don't speak English and often rely on us to translate things or help with certain tasks, quite regularly. In the past, my sister has never minded helping out. Now she says she's being treated as a ""slave"" for having to do these things. This is just one example of things that can build resentment. Anything that has not been done perfectly is automatically my dad's fault - my sister feels an irrational degree of anger whenever inconvenienced by my parents. While I completely agree that our parents definitely over-relies on us and it can get annoying at times, it's no excuse to throw a fit and constantly complain. It's at a point where no one asks her to do anything now and we're all just walking on eggshells.Now how do I feel about this? Well, I don't think her moving to China is a good idea, especially since her plan to make money relies on content creation which currently isn't earning enough to support her (she believes that she can expand enough to make it work). She can only speak Chinese and cannot read or write it. That being said, she's a grown ass woman (26+) so I believe that if she truly wants to go, then she should just go and do it, even if it's stupid and might end poorly.My parents think different - they want to stop her from doing this at any cost. They believe it's their responsibility to stop her from doing something risky, no matter what. I can also feel as if my parents look down on her boyfriend for being in China and that she's downgrading herself and her life. This is is likely another reason why there's so much contention. After all, from my sister's perspective, my parents barely speak any English and rely on their children to translate everything, what right do they have to look down on him for being in China?For me, I try my best to calm everyone down. But I can't take it anymore. I say just her go and if she messes up a few years of her life, that's on her. But nope, our parents are insistent that she shouldn't go. When we're all together, there's so much noise in the house. What good is it to force people to stay together if they can no longer see eye to eye?Part of me just wants to move out to stop having to listen to all these arguments. These constant shouting matches (even from the sidelines) are stressing me out so much. But I can't move out yet. My parents don't speak English and when my sister finally moves out, they'll have to rely on me when it comes to translating / making calls / reading letters / filling out forms / setting up accounts, etc. I can't just abandon them.I do eventually plan on moving out, but not at this point, because there's too much uncertainty given the current market.Anyone else ever been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it?TL;DR Sister wants to move to China to be with her boyfriend. Parents vehemently oppose it and are trying everything to prevent it.

Snap,not today.,How to handle a tough sibling?,"My biological mom passed away. Ever since it’s been my responsibility to take care of my sibling.I cared for them like a parent. Sacrificed my career. Relationships. Lost so many opportunities due to the mental torture they’ve put me through. Despite that I endured. Because I cared for them and it was my responsibility. At one point not so long ago I was only living for them.I’m just tired of their entitlement and ungratefulness. I try to turn a blind eye with everything they do that’s trivial. But when it comes to things that make or break your life I am forced to step in to take control.When I do so they put up with me until the shit gets sorted and immediately after they’re back to where it all started. They’ll now start to harm me, curse at me and say bad things about me. I’m just done with their BS, but I cannot let go of them despite what they do.I did let them fail to teach them a lesson a few times. But that learning never happens. I’ve spent a lot of money on them and determined to spend even more on anything that could help their situation. Therapy, better lifestyle, you name it.I was planning to start a family soon but I’m having second thoughts now — what if my kid turns out to be like this? I just cannot endure another such failure. It will be me raising the kid from the get go so the chances are slim. And also, I won’t let them anywhere close to my father, so the chances are really slim. But in the off chance, they do turn out like my sibling.. that would be the absolute end of me.I’m so sick of it. How are parents with bad kids dealing these days?Just for some more context I’m in my early thirties and they’re in their early twenties.Edit: I changed the title from “failing” to tough.

New,TAperson,I really dislike leaving my house,"Im just ranting here so please bare with me. Yeah… so I used to be someone that was incredibly outgoing and had friends, went to the clubs, parties, hangouts, travel etc. But just a few months before the pandemic started a light just turned off in me. I was going through some hardship of dealing with sexual assault and also heartbreak. But also after completing my masters degree not a single person would hire. I had to move back home to my mom’s house and everyday she would call me lazy, a bum, and threaten to kick me out at least once a month all why interviewing and applying to jobs like crazy. Fast forward to 3 years and I landed a great job in tech recruitment making good money and even was able to move out 4 months ago. But that feeling of not wanting to leave the house just got worse! I’ve been trying to push myself by canceling Doordash, pharmacy delivery, Instacart etc to force me to leave the house (which is tolerable). I made a new friend at a bday party earlier this year and we started hanging out more. She loves doing her hair, makeup, and dressing up to go hit downtown area. I absolutely detest downtown and even more so crowds especially on a weekend. The few times I went with her downtown, I had to focus really hard on not getting overwhelmed outside. I’ve honestly am doing the best that I can. Yes I do have depression but I’ve been on some great medications to mellow me out. I have no issues being a homebody but at the same time I am in my late 20s and according to society I should be hitting the streets. Guess I’m just trying to figure out a good balance. #mentalhealth",,11/24/2022,18,621,6,Family Issue,Mental Health

Intel,itpro12,Should I go to therapy and stretch myself thin in the process,"Next week I'm doing a video call with a potential therapist, and financially I can't really afford to see them easily. I just got super lucky this weekend and found a room in the silicon valley for only 500/mo, but it has no lease agreement and is month to month. So far I'm getting along well with my roommate, but you never know with month to month agreements. I also have a loan I'm trying to pay off early that's 36 percent, and currently if I pay $1000/month I can pay it off by July or earlier. If I see this new therapist then financially I will be stretched fairly thin, in my budget I will still have a decent amount of left over money. But if the 500/month place doesn't work out and I suddenly have to find a new room, then my 2 options are rent free with my parents, but my mom always misgender's me and uses my deadname, and also 2.5hrs of commute time to work because she lives in a suburb far away from everything. And if I choose to stay in the silicon valley then my next room will probably be $1-1.5k. The therapist I might see charges $215/session. If I have to move then I won't be able to pay down my debts and see a therapist at the same time.

I want someone to checkin or help me stay organized. I tried volunteering for some days but didn't stick to it. Stress eating caused to put in lots of weight.

Amazon,chucksull,To Asian American Men - Moving to Asia - Changed My Life,"Hi,Recently, I've been reading a lot of posts on blind. All of these great guys, that make plenty of money, in the valley or Seattle, that are depressed because they're single. I wanted to share my story, and hope many of you will make the same decision as me.I used to work at Microsoft in a good finance role. I went to Microsoft post bschool. Great job. Good pay. Stock rising. Got promoted. All good from career.But, I'm Asian American. 5'9 / 5'10. I was 32 at the time. Single. I have a underbite that can't be corrected without very invasive surgery, which is quite noticeable. I'm a little overweight for an Asian American, but working on that. I'm not particularly athletic. I have a slight stutter. From an American perspective, this is not an ideal external profile. Think of it this way < 1% right swipes for me.While I think I have a good personality, in Seattle, I sorta felt like a loser. I had / have a few close Asian American friends and went to a good church, which was super helpful, but everyday I felt like I was drifting by. I loved my job, but my personal life wasn't great.If I'm completely honest, having women like me either platonic / romantically is a very important part of my life. I believe it's an important part of most men's life. That's never been the case for me. I have a feeling that's the same for many Asian American men here.So I was going to Asia for work a lot and whenever I went, I was like, wow, this is amazing. I have a few friends from bschool that lived here and they were so great to me. I decided I really wanted to make the move.1. Good Total Comp. Same or equal to Microsoft.2. Live in the city center3. Work on something I enjoyGrace of God, I received an offer that met those requirements.So I moved to Asia.In Asia, I don't feel like a loser. I have a group of great Asian American / Asian Canadian / Asian European friends that are like me that too has made the difference.I have a loving and caring girlfriend that has made my Christmas incredible. I have been blessed with a great group of friends. We play board games / go out / have gatherings regularly throughout the week. I play in a bball league and i'm not good at basketball, but it's fun.For those of you that are feeling low in the US. I understand. I don't want to uproot your lives. I don't want to tell you that Asia is better. That's not my place.I just want to offer an alternative.I know what it's like to be an Asian American in the US, where data shows that Asian men for many nuanced reasons, tend to only liked by Asian women and about 50% of Asian women, probably still prefer non Asian men. Being liked also plays a huge part when it comes to charisma. People like to be around people that have charisma, and if society views the people group as sort of an outside group, then it's hard to have charisma. It's not about racism, just Asian Americans in the US aren't considered American really, and so that affects a lot of aspects of our life in ways that are different than other minority groups and in a way that white people probably can't understand / don't understand / don't want to understand. I understand a lot to unpack there. Happy to go into more detail / analysis. Just something true about the United States. I understand there are some underlying assumptions that some people / many people may disagree with me here. Let's discuss if you'd like. Happy to share data as well.I have a dream that no Asian American will ever feel out of place again, if I can help, I will.I've helped five people as part of their move to Asia. They are really happy. They make same or a little less than they did in the US.I don't want anyone to ever feel the way I did. In the US, I probably could be making ~300K including stock appreciation. In the bay / seattle you will probably like your job more as I have found working with Americans is easier than working with Asians I would say as a whole in general.I know I'm generalizing a lot. I know a lot of Asian American men that are much happier in Asia than in the US. I don't know that many Asian American men that are happier in the US than in Asia. If you can get in a situation where you can be based here but work on a global team, I say do it.Personal life is really important and anyone that has thought about moving to Asia, please PM me. I promise to help you if I can.TC: ~200KEdit 1 - Thanks for the responses! I've received a ton of PMs. Most asked questions are:1. How do you get started?2. Will they sponsor your visa1. How you get started is changing your linkedin location to the location you want to be based. Be PATIENT. I spent a year planning my move. DO NOT SETTLE for a job that is a demotion. Lateral at worst or upward trajectory is what you are looking for.2. YES! They will sponsor your visa. Any country in Asia is happy to find someone with your skills to contribute to the economy.Edit 2 -Hi Everyone, thanks so much for your comments. I'm really sorry that a portion of the thread devolved into just dating. It wasn't supposed to.My meta point was that how people perceive you is very important.I'm popular in Asia. I have a lot of friends. I'm invited to things. I'm eloquent. I'm confident. Girls like you. Female colleagues admire me. They want to learn more about me. Guys want to be connected with me. People proactively reach out to me.I'm the same person as the US. In the US, I didn't have a lot of friends. I wasn't invited to things. My eloquence is translated as someone that's too opinionated. My confidence into what people perceive as arrogance.For people that think this is a confidence problem, anyone knows me knows that I'm not unconfident. It's not that. It's not that I didn't try. Aggressive attempts at women in the US are interpreted as creepy. This is a Me Too Age. A generalization that I believe in is that an unattractive guy that attempts to court a woman, is considered creepy. A good looking guy is considered romantic.I've literally done and said the same things to women.In the US - she literally told my boss she thought I was creepy because she knew my boss from a wine tasting class or something.In Asia - she said yes and asked why I didn't ask earlier.Same words. Same tone. Same syntax. Only things that were different are different girl and different location.That is what changed people here and the US.Edit 3:I was born in the United States. Grew up in New York and California.Edit 4: I am so happy to have received so many comments and messages. I've received 50+ messages asking for help and questions. I'm here to help all of you. If moving to Asia can help your life, let's figure this out. You've made the first step. If I can ask all of you to first change your location on your linkedin to the location you want to be based. This is the first step. COVID obviously changes things but finding the job and moving, the process will take about a year, but you can do it.",,12/21/2020,1425,56400,707,Immigration Issue,Depressed

Over voice chat, 2 teenagers(?) we’re asking me endless questions about myself and just ripping on each of my answers. They asked what I do, I said I was a software engineer and they started insulting me in every way, ranging from saying my BMI is probably disgusting, to saying how I’m on the brink of poverty and that I probably live in my moms basement, and things like that. It was like 1 AM so I didn’t really have the energy to entertain it since I work the next morning, and they kept pressing about how I forgot to take my medication tonight and how I’m a lifeless loser. They asked me if I had a girlfriend and when I said yes, they told me that she’s definitely gunna cheat on me because I’m that kind of guy.I love my life. I love my job and my girlfriend and I’m definitely not depressed. I’m very secure mentally when it comes to these things.

Microsoft,RvrH57,"Please, my goodness, someone help :/ Anxiety at work, don't know how to fix a bad situation","I've developed a crippling anxiety about work that I'm struggling to overcome. I used to be a top performer, but in the past year between a breakup and a death in the family, my mental health took a nosedive. I went on medical leave earlier this year, but shortly before I was to return to work my doctor decided to change my ADHD medication, and because he takes a cautious approach, he started me at below the minimum dose, set to begin my first day of work. (The problems with that approach seem obvious, but I felt powerless to ask for even the minimum dose or ask for an extension of the leave to ensure it worked--he said he wanted to see how it fared in a real work environment.) (For reference, it was Vyvanse and he was starting me on 10mg, when the usual starting dose is 30mg.)So of course I struggled those first several weeks back at the office, and I sensed my work was bad, and that made me feel bad talking to my team, and thus I avoided interacting. I felt very anxious and avoidant in general, and even when I felt brave enough to face my work I struggled to focus on it. I got my annual review for this year and received 10%, which I think is nominally average but functionally slightly below average. (Previously it was always 16-18%.)It's been like two months since being back, and for several weeks my doctor even took me off the medication completely because of a potential side effect I was having (which turned out to be a non-issue). So only last week did I get put on 40mg, but honestly, I felt so behind and so ashamed of being behind (I felt too anxious and ashamed to even open the IDE) that I said I would just take a day off to work in private and catch up, but then I was too anxious to face it, and then it went on until (shameful) it's been like two weeks of just marking myself OOF every day, and I still haven't opened the IDE. Pathetic and shameful. I'm not even going out and having fun; I force myself to sit at my computer the whole time, but even then I can't face it.My manager is aware of my issues, but he went on paternity a month ago and is due back in two weeks. I'm supposed to be paired with a coworker on a project, and at one point I told him I was still dealing with my health problem hence the delay, and that our manager and HR were aware (talked to HR, still need to submit a form for accommodation). He seemed chill about it, but I still felt awful. And now it's been so long since we synced or had an update, and I'm just OOF this whole time.How could I possibly dig myself out of this hole? I wanted to quit so bad just to relieve the anxiety, but I know that's probably not wise, both because of the economy and because it won't actually fix anything. I should try to fix things. But like I said, at this point, even opening my IDE fills me with a physical tingling level of shame and anxiety. I'm afraid to ask my friends for help or support because I'm afraid of showing just how bad my situation is. Mentioned something vague to my closest friend (different city) and she suggested working in the same room as a friend for accountability and support, but even if I'm able to explain my needs (very scary), I still need to open the IDE and face the amount I have to catch up on. And I'm afraid to show that level of panic in front of my friends who seem to have it together so much better; it would be my first time being so vulnerable in front of the friends I've made here in Seattle, and I'm worried they won't understand cause they're all smart and capable tech bros and everything is always chill, and their opinion of me will transform from a peer into that of a hysteric and helpless woman.Please, dear God, can anyone suggest a way to fix this? My psychiatrist didn't seem to get it and basically just showed disapproval when I explained that I took days off of work to work but failed at it, so I'm scared to talk to him (this post makes him sound bad but he's actually historically wonderful, this is his first failure). Therapy appointment is on the 12th but idek how they could help me. The doctors all want to solve the problem on a deep level (anxiety about judgment), which is fair, but in the meantime this work issue is urgent; I need to stay employed.Normal advice is ""talk to your manager"" but he's not even here. And what do you even say? I don't think my doctor will approve going back on leave. I wish I could ask for emotional safety and space to catch up, some kind of ""You're behind but it's okay, and now that it's in the open you can take a few days to safely catch up and ask for help without judgment."" But who would I ask? My skip? My project partner, a standoffish older man for whom the only personal thing he's said are jokes where the punchline is that he secretly hates his kids? I feel hopeless.Thank you for reading this far. Any and all advice is deeply appreciated.lvl 61, 4 YOE, TC don't know cause too anxious to open the portal",,10/5/2022,28,818,13,Family Issue,Anxiety

I barely have any motivation to do anything l am not even enjoying that much the new place I moved to, my work, sports.

Here's some common questions I get:Are things like depression, ADHD, autism, dyslexia and anxiety really considered disabilities?Yes. This includes chronic and episodic conditions that are substantially limiting when active, such as bipolar disorder.What are accommodations?Accommodations require medical documentation from a healthcare provider, which can be a therapist, counselor, psychiatrist, psychologist, GP, specialist doctor, etc. Accommodations support professionals to perform the essential functions of their job by providing adjustments to:- The work environment- Existing training materials or processes- Work hours and scheduling- Supervisory methods- Communication methods- Access to resources or assistive technologyWhat are examples of accommodations I could ask for?- Reduced schedule- Maximum of 2 hour meeting blocks to allow for breaks- Adjusted schedule, such as shifting core hours to later in the day- Flexible schedule to allow time for medical appointments during workday- Intermittent leave to accommodate unplanned flare-ups of medical condition- Uninterrupted work time, such as the ability to use DND for up to three hours per day- Noise cancelling headphones- Desk away from foot traffic for minimal distractions- Wall dividers on either side of desk to block visual distractions- Ability to work from home a certain number of days per week- Supervisor provides feedback in writing 24 hours in advance of 1:1 so employee has time to process feedback.- Written instructions for tasks with explicit timeline, due dates, and clear expectations and measures of success- Adopting a succinct or explicit communication style in conversations and emails with employee.- Verbal or written recaps after lengthy or complex conversations- Job Coaching.

I’ve seen most of these accommodations both approved and denied, sometimes both by the same employer. It depends on the team's specific business needs and the employee’s medical needs. Accommodations are often a negotiation process to figure out what's effective and reasonable for both parties; there's no ""rulebook"" that outlines everything that's reasonable and unreasonable. HR, managers, and employees often work together to create effective accommodations. The best way to find out is to start by requesting a confidential conversation with a member of your accommodations or HR team.While I'm ramping up my business I'm giving free 30 minute consultations on questions related to managing mental health and neurodivergence at work.

He even told my family my kids are scared of me, which is not true because I adore them and they can never wait until I get off work.One of my sisters told me, ""I can't get over the fact you are autistic and have ADHD. People are born with it, they don't develop it when they're adults.""Another of my sisters downplayed my conditions by saying, ""Everyone has a little bit of adhd and autism, you don't need to take medication. Just control your thoughts.""Hearing these things broke my heart, because my neurodivergent mind should not be seen as an inconvenience to others. I try my best to explain when I have unsettling moments, but it's all seen as excuses for my behavior.

Google,dessertsaf,With high TC comes high depression,"Wife and I both work at FAANG in the Bay Area. Ages 30/29, combined TC 850K+, net worth 1.5M. No debts (renting, student loans paid off), no kids, perfect health. Aware of how lucky we are to have this life.Just had another of those stressful days at work, where both end up fully exhausted. Then we had a big fight over a small issue. Went to bed angry at each other. Drained of all energy but I can’t sleep. Questioning myself how will we sustain this life. Feeling the sense that our life and our youth is slipping by while we keep drudging along.We have been planning a home purchase. Bank approved a loan for a 2.5M home with 20% down. After fighting bidding wars over many homes, we finally got into contract with a property that we liked a lot. Then, we backed out because we couldn’t commit to working our jobs long enough to pay off the mortgage. Can’t imagine putting away so much of our monthly cash into a mortgage. Anything cheaper than 2M is difficult to get excited about, we’d rather rent.Thinking about having kids, but we get worried by all the shit that’s happening in the world. Wondering what’s the point of bringing someone to a world like this. And seeing the stress that our colleagues who are parents go through each day scares us.While in school, I pictured myself solving big problems, creating real value, inventing something useful and/or running a successful company. Right now I am just a cog in a trillion $ machine. On the other hand, it feels difficult to survive in the Bay Area on a startup salary. And the FOMO is real of seeing friends continue to make high TC at FAANG while you drudge along at a startup for years, deal with nasty politics, with potentially getting handed peanuts at exit.It’s not that we never have any good times, though. Most of the weekends we enjoy each other’s company and love doing stuff together. But the jobs are crushing our souls, sucking away at our time and energy, and turning us against each other. When we think about the future we get depressed by the non stop treadmill. We think of running away leaving everything behind.But we are immigrants, we have come from humble backgrounds. Leaving behind this kind of money simply feels wrong. Also our visas are tied to our jobs. So we keep dreaming about making *enough* then making an escape. But *enough* never materializes, the goal keeps shifting. I don’t know if I’ll even survive to enjoy the money in the end. If not the pandemic, the depression might kill me.Thanks for reading. If you are in the same boat, know that you aren’t alone. If you are dreaming about having our TC and are working hard for that next job or promo, more power to you and I wish you can cherish the journey you’re on, because you’re not going to like the destination as much as you may think.And if you’re someone who has figured this shit out, please share your wisdom. Is there hope? Or has Silicon Valley devolved into a hedonic rat race of maximizing TC at all costs? Is the answer to run to a LCOL area and trade off some TC for some sanity, socially distancing from the “Blind, Robinhood, Redfin” crowd whose life is all about TC, stocks and real estate?EDIT - wow this went viral. Thanks for so many great, thoughtful responses, Blind community! If anyone is going through similar issues, try to read through the comments as it will be super helpful. It feels good to know that we are not alone in this.To those who are hating on this, calling it a troll, or not able to accept that someone can have such problems when they have so much. I hear you. My post is entirely true, but I can also understand why it might seem like no big deal to you. Not trying to brag or belittle anyone else’s struggles. Just an honest post about my own struggles, which I felt would be useful for those who are going through the same, and for those who only see this life from the outside.I agree that my issues are not terrible at all, and I have the means to fix them, while many don’t have that. It’s great to see that people on this app care enough to give useful advice, and not just talk about TC or GTFO. I’ll try to implement some of the suggestions in my life and hopefully post again next year with some positive progress.",850000,11/14/2020,1034,82300,1215,Family Issue,Stress

This weekend, I just went to the gym, then sat in my room drinking tequila and playing team fortress 2.I regret spending time studying in college and high school instead of making friends or trying to get into a relationship.I haven't made any close friends in the ~1 year I've been working full-time. Practically nobody comes into the office, much less anyone my age. I have ""friends"", but I'm always the one initiating the conversation and they always have something else going on. I have no idea where to even start with dating -- I'm just a short Indian SWE but I don't even speak any Indian languages.I have tons of free time outside of work that I usually spend trying halfheartedly to find a purpose (going to random events on Meetup, buying stuff I don't need, studying textbooks, working out etc.). I've wanted to do some online classes, but they just make me feel even more disconnected and lonely.At this point, my apathy has spread to my work. I wake up at 10 am completely unmotivated and usually stretch out my day until 8/9 pm just to fill the hours. My work is replete with errors and oversights because I only put 5-10% of my attention towards it. When I started on the team, the work sounded interesting, but so much of it is just adding random features and fixing bugs, so even if I worked much harder, I wouldn't learn anything significant.I'm desperately seeking something I can anchor myself to so that I don't wake up every morning feeling like an absolute loser with nothing to live for.I know this problem isn't unique: I've talked to a lot of people in a similar boat.How did you get out of this fog, or if you didn't, how do you cope?

Now, it’s only people who do a lot of talking and joking that have remained. I dread each morning when I wake up and wouldn’t get out of bed until my first meeting of the day. I used to be someone who woke up before sunrise, worked out , meditate, read in the first few hours of the day. I have sometimes had suicidal thoughts cos I really wanted to achieve something in life. I feel like a loser.Now, I have just become someone who I don’t really know. I have been applying for jobs but no other companies are hiring at this moment and more than that I am scared that all jobs are going to be similar in nature. And I may be stuck for life.I can’t quit cos I am on a visa. It won’t be long before they know I ain’t doing anything. It’s like they want me to not do anything.Is it like this everywhere?

Ironclad,♾ ♾,Single for 4 years (not even a fling),"So this is me.I didn’t date anyone since graduating from college. 9 time out of 10, I eat lunch/dinner alone even in restaurants even on my birthday, work out alone at night, and there are many days that I don’t even step outside of my house.When I do hangout with friends, it is not awkward at all, and I do socialize quite well. Those meetings are usually all guys (4-7 guys) and I hear them talk about exciting nights and dates that they had back in their home country or in places like New York City (I live in SF) a couple weeks ago. Those things make me wonder, maybe it is not me but it is just this place and area. But not so sure if I would do anything drastically different in other cities (I don’t have that many close friends whose parties I can crash in those areas anyways)I am not sure if I feel lonely, or am just used to being lonely. Currently, I have not seen anyone that attractive for me to really approach and spend my time on in the last 4 years. I usually either work, workout, prepare for my own startup, and play computer games ( maybe a couple hours a week ).I am not sure if what I am doing is a waste of youth (as my friends say if not date a lot now, when would you). I just feel confused from time to time when I look at myself retroactively as a third person - I could be looked at as a passionate guy who has some busy plans ahead or a lonely guy who rots and slowly fades away.I don’t even know if I will regret my current life in the future. Maybe I actually won’t if my life turns out to be great in the future.I don’t have too much savings or NW at the moment. My motto is screw rest and vest life at least for next 5-7 years and try to take risks/challenges to succeed. But I could also fail and just would have been better off working for a big tech, saving as much as I can, date a lot of women after moving to NYC or LA while building my career.Idk what which life, outcome I will regret.

She's not a bad person, she has a lot of good things and virtues. I just find communicating between us to be difficult because we're different. I want us to be partners and agree on things, but we have a different understanding of what that means.Concerns-She isn't able to be independent and feel responsible for her (legally, I am responsible for her since I've sponsored her green card).-She doesn't work and pretty adverse to get any kind of job, even a remote one, she has her own business and I'm doing the taxes now and see it's only made a few hundred last year (up for losing a thousands the previous years)-She wants to buy a house/rent a new place and have a child, but wants to do nothing to financially contribute to it (even if she had a minimum wage job, I'd feel at least we're both trying), instead she wants me to put all my savings from before getting married into it, I find it extremely unfair. Instead we have a budget on what we agree on.-We fight over not hiring cleaners to pay to clean the apartment, if we were both busy working and not home, sure, but she's home all day and so am I-We're about to pay off her car and she wants to buy a new one-Have to set a budget with her and give her an allowance (if I don't set a budget, she'll seriously spend out of control, like buying tons of stuff from Zara, we just got her credit card debt under control, so it isn't fiscally responsible to have her direct access)-We're starting to give too much money to her family back home (her dad begs her for money), since the exchange rate is so good with the US dollar, I'm not overly concerned with it and it's not tons-She's explode with anger if something doesn't go her way, I'm terrified to have children with her due to that. I grew up with my mom like that to my dad and I don't want to have kids like that - I've communicated this to her repeatedly and she seems to ignore it-She has ups and downs, when she's ""good"" things are mostly fine, but just fine. When things aren't good, she's at her worst. She doesn't have a ""-If certain plans don't work out, she has a meltdown. For my birthday, she was opposed to what I wanted to do and I couldn't get a reservation for a Michelin restaurant, but I found a decent fallback on the waterfront, I had such relief because otherwise I thought my birthday would have been crap as she'd been in a terrible mood if we didn't get itSome personality things that just exhaust me:-She's overly negative or sarcastic, often yelling at the TV and says things like ""hope you republicans that get covid die"", I'm an optimistic person, its exhausting listen to someone so pessimistic-Complains about little things or trivial things that becomes exhausting to hear like ""I don't like that car driving by me"" or about some people not wearing masks-Most of her day is doing hobbies like astrology, Instagram, etc. If I ask about her business, she blames it on covid and gets angryI'm depressed with work and I feel my relationship exhausts me. Usually you get something out of relationships, right? I'm not sure what I get out of mine. Lately I find myself ignoring her more. If I talk, she isn't listening to me. If I offer my thoughts she discards them. However, she does try to be supportive for me with work. She does agree to a budget when spending food.I'm not sure if I ignored these things before or our relationship has changed. Or maybe we should have ended our relationship long ago. We're in couples therapy. She's seeing a therapist.End rant.Edit 1: Really appreciate all the support and positivity people are giving rather than make fun of the situation.

They are not bad people and always gave me the best of everything. But when it comes to being sensitive or saying the right things, they are just so terrible at it and it’s left so much of anger in me. This is now creeping into my 30’s1. I had my first child 3 years back and was receiving from a very difficult labor with complications. My parents yelled and had a big fight with me because I could not take calls from relatives who wanted to wish me. That part just stayed with me. It was less than 12 hours since I delivered and even then they had 0 concerns for me and more about satisfying relatives in India.2. Fast forward to the current day, I am now pregnant with my 2nd child and dealing with extreme fatigue and morning sickness that is so bad that I cannot move from my bed after 5 pm. It was Diwali yesterday and I was feeling very unwell in the evening. They never asked me once how I was doing and instead there was again a big argument about calling and wishing relatives for Diwali. My parents called out how they failed to raise me right and how my attitude is so terrible. Just makes me wonder if they really care for me. I just spent all morning crying about the relationship I have with them3. Anytime I try to discipline my child, I am constantly told that why are you telling her this when you were such an bad kid. She is so much better than you. She seems to be so adamant just like you.And I just let it go everytime and I feel bad that they are getting old.

While I saw some anger issues in her during the time, I let it slide thinking they were resulting due to long distance relationship.Fast forward to February 2020, she finds a job in my city and moves in with me.

The arguments would be for some really trivial hairline triggers for instance, say I didn't turn on the heater before I the started the car. If I didn't walk fast enough from the car to the store she we would say ""You will make me go tan"". These arguments will result in a ""no talking"" period for about a couple of hours.

Chime,%#,"Before you are too old, prepare for retirement","There is plenty of information on savings, but I want to share another important aspect: start asap several hobbies you like and can do also when you are old. Even better if they require social interactions and being outside of your place.Your spouse might leave you, or die, or you never marry. Your friends can disappear. Your family and kids have their own path. Your job will end one day, you will have a massive amount of free time, time to think. I saw many close ones falling in depression, mental and health problems, fading away from who they were. Some attempted suicide. It's brutal.Some others are having their best lives. One specifically, after an ugly divorce and tough times, met a great partner and now, both retired, are having the time of their lives. All thanks to their common passion.I hope you all will have a great and happy life, full of people who love you and family close. But for me and many others it's not going to happen, and having ways to connect with like minded people and have a good time for all your lifetime is the best strategy you can have to be happy long term.I'll also add that doing it when you are young builds more great memories and it will be even more enjoyable once you are old and can recall those feelings.Getting started to something new and really cultivate a passion takes time, skill and energy. My advice is to start possibly before your 40s. But of course better late than never.A series of events triggered me this reflection and, since I never though or heard about it, I thought it could be helpful to someone else.Stay safe, enjoy lifeTc ~200k, hopefully retiring in 6 years.#mentalhealth",,8/31/2022,17,768,31,Family Issue,Mental Health

New,QOxx05,Depression Supplements,"Posting most of OTC supplements I take specifically to help manage my chronic depression (below dotted line).I've been battling it without prescribed meds for about 15 yrs. It got really bad when lockdown started and my job went fully remote. The isolation sent me into a deeper depressive phase after work burnout. It took me nearly two years to get my life back on track and find a supplement blend that works for me. I don't know that I'll ever fully be what I remember as my normal self again because my depression is heavily biological and getting worse as I age. But I'm hell of a lot better now than I have been in many years, and I hope that my current regimen helps me to maintain longer.Sharing for a few groups of ppl:Some folks, like me, know they have clinical depression but don't want to take antidepressants.Some folks have depression and maybe want to try tapering off of their antidepressants (NOT recommending tapering off if your prescription works for you. If the side effects of antidepressants are getting out of hand, however, there may be some alternatives here)You haven't been officially diagnosed but suspect you may be having a depressive episode or are clinically depressed.Edit: Lastly, this thread kicked off a couple of exchanges. Please check user ribbed's post in the comments - they pointed out some things to be mindful of when buying supplements online, specifically through Amazon, and provided resources for more ingredient research and supplement sourcing. They also noted to start one thing at a time, which I didn't mention here but is important - I started all of these one at a time, not all at once.----------------------MAGNESIUM, OPTIMALLY MAGNESIUM TAURATE - Magnesium has lots of general health benefits but has been proven clinically to help alleviate depression when taken above recommended daily amounts. Most pill, powder and liquid forms come as magnesium glycinate or magnesium chloride. Optimal form for brain tissue absorption is taurate and I've generally only found taurate in pill form. Brand I found on Amazon Double Wood supplements, 70 day supply for 25 - 30 I believeDOPABOOST - A blend of synthesized proteins and plant extracts known to promote body's natural dopamine production. Only one brand with this on Amazon 30 day supply for 40. To stretch I take half dose to make bottle last two monthsVITAMIN D - Several health benefits but with fall here and winter approaching getting vitamin D through sun exposure will be a challenge. If your depression is seasonal this is a problem, if your depressions not seasonal you still need to supplement vitamin d intake for normal bodily function. If your skin is any darker than say the color of bamboo wood, the amount of melanin your skin produces suppresses/reduces absorption of solar energy components which includes vitamin d. Folks of color especially check your vitamin d levels with a doctor to see if you need to supplement, basic bloodwork you get with your annual physical will tell. I take the sport research brand at double the dose on the bottle, one bottle lasts 6 months. 20 on AmazonHORNY GOAT WEED (HGW) - Testosterone production supplement. Women naturally produce testosterone also, the hormone impacts some aspects of cognition among many other things in the body. If you're having libido problems it might help there too. One of my biggest challenges with the depression has been fatigue, I was exhausted all of the time even if I did nothing all day. This is the supplement that gave me some of my energy back and also started noticeably clearing my mental fogginess (aka depression fog, this is a documented symptom of depression. If you're having trouble remembering things short term, struggling to work through simple problems and keep track of time, feeling like everything's a bit surreal or ""hazy"" - this is the fog in effect). I get Dorado Nutrition brand which has other things blended with the HGW 30 day supply/halve it to stretch two months, 20 or 30 I believe.NOOTROPICS - A LOT of options in this category. I take Doctor's Best brand Brain Enhancers, noticeable effect in less than half an hour. Clears my depression fog completely (HGW alone cleared only a little) and was the supplement that finally let me feel closest to normal for the first time in 15 years. I don't believe this supplement by itself accomplished this though which is why I list all the other stuff. Take half dose a day bottle comes with full dose 30 day supply. 20 - 25 I believeZEN STRESS RELIEF - herbal blend adaptogen supplement, helps me not to have anxiety spirals if I'm triggered throughout the day. Take full dose daily, bottle is 30 day supply. WellPath brand 20 on Amazon.ASHWAGANDA POWDER - Another adaptogen, comes out or mixed with lots of things. I get Sunbird Organics dark Cocoa powder mixed with ashwa powder. Atp I don't know if I really need this one but cocoa enhancers coffee flavor and I love a good cup of coffee so I keep it. 20 bucks a bag which I think last 3.5 - 4 weeks @ 1 serving/dayHope this helps.",,10/18/2022,23,463,5,Loneliness,Burnout

Not much is uncertain.Now recession enters the chat. A lot of people are panicking and unhappy about life. To make it worse, they will send their negative emotions to you.Now you are likely to feel bad due to the following reasons:- Relationships are throwing negative emotions to you- Work is harder than ever due to competitions and layoffs, but pay is not guaranteed/lower- However, the world is designed to still send the same/more bills/responsibilities to you.Most people are not accustomed to this new reality. It’s time to think about different strategies for your life:- Simple living. Can you cut some bills? Can you be less ambitious about life so that you can focus more on work?- Emotion support. Find friends/family or therapist to get support.- Set boundaries. You are not likely to take more work/life responsibilities. Can you delegate some of them?

There were so many people going in and going out, but he was following me and my family all the time.

Mind you, these are the team members I helped carry their weight over extended period during COVID when they’re sick and travels. A complete lack of concern or care let alone empathy from these so called teammates when I was out sick bred disgust. I am truly sad to see a company like Apple does very little to build or improve a sense of belonging and team camaraderie. How do I deal with this, would rather quit than switch teams at this point.TC: Not relevant to this rantEDIT: to those who ask why can’t you switch teams? Unlike Meta, Amazon or any other sane employer, Apple makes internal candidates jump through lot of hoops and work twice as hard than external candidates with a lengthy process and no change in pay. You’d need to let your current manager know before you’re interviewing, go through a full loop like external candidate, be willing to answer any and all clarifications or concerns your current manager added on your performance record and HR file, yes the recruiter/hiring manager will have access to this once you apply for an internal role. Your new hiring manager has to work with old manager for a transition plan on their terms. And you’re shit out of luck if you don’t get along with your current manager, Apples HR response to this is like stay in a abusive relationship, work out your differences with your manager and get great record next year. It’s like being stuck in a bad marriage; you could divorce and start anew by quitting.

They are seeing a counselor who recommended seeing a psychiatrist. There are no appointments available for the next few weeks. These are some of the behaviors.Extremely anxious, worried, and scared to resign from their current job. They believe they own the code they wrote and are responsible for all future maintenance. Their employer can sue if they resign. Their team, manager, and skip are going to find bugs in the code and threaten them to stay and find issues in the code. I tried explaining employment at will. They are not listening and not understanding. They say CEO is going to come after them. Their boss, skip and so many others are going to frame them.Walking restlessly all waking hours, roaming around the house all the timeTalking to themselves a lot, brushing teeth multiple times during the day, crying, I think slapping themselves(they say they are clapping)Talking to me nonstop not giving me a break from them, chasing me wherever I am going, and saying they feel like constantly talking.Till we get an appointment with psychiatrist, is there anything we can try?Update 1: Thank you all for your inputs and suggestions. They have therapy appointments next week and the following week. I also bought some OTC meds and drinks prescribed here. They are taking those and they are not going into full-blown episodes. I have figured out where to go in case of a psychiatric emergency.One question they asked me to ask blind: are they responsible for code, and bugs that occur in code after they resign? If not the person who wrote it, who is going to take care of it? What if no one else in the company is knowledgeable about it. I tried explaining a lot and they are not listening to me. I know only a mental health professional can talk through these. In case, you can respond, that will be enormously helpful.Update 2: Update 2: They resigned from their job and got sleep meds from the PCP. Dont know which one helped but there are no episodes and they are sleeping for 3-5 hours. We have many therapy sessions. None of the reactions they expected from their boss, skip happened. They tried to retain and behaved reasonably, as any professional would.They are second-guessing their decision to resign quite a bit. But this has been a pattern even before this episode too. Extreme aversion to making changes, and decisions. They apply every extreme scenario to not make or retract a decision.

Multiple times I tried talking to the people involved but no change in their behavior. My parents are involved, so even if I ignore others, my parents vent it out to me and I have to hear them. Have tried explaining to them too that it’s affecting my mental health now and sometimes they will have to learn to say ‘no’ to others, but nothing much has changed.Last year I walked out of toxic relationship, was healing from it and then went through some politics at work where my promotion was passed down to someone else to retain them.I started prepping for interviews, but whenever the whole family drama starts again, I lose interest and motivation to do anything in life these days. Takes me a week or so to get back to normal and start focusing again and then there will be drama entering my life after another few weeks.

Apple,chickn65,"My friend needs psychological help, but he isn’t ready to get it","* No trolls please, seriously looking for help, posting the same in other social platforms as well *TLDR: My friend needs psychological/mental help but he isn't agreeing to seeing a doctorMy friend is in a psychological state where he hears voices speaking to him. These voices tell him different things, he responds to those voices by talking back (to himself). Every time he enters restroom he immediately starts talking to himself, so it seems like these voices are heard so often. So far he hasn't done any violent acts but he has been losing jobs one after another.Background: He was a very jovial guy until 2 years back when he got married (arranged in India). There have been some fights between his family and his in-laws. I think that might have been the starting point. He never got along with his wife, who never lived with him until now. He also has a history of drugs (mostly marijuana) including cocaine (once or twice I was told, but could have been more times)Current situation:1. He has been losing jobs one after another since he is not able to focus.2. He misplaces a lot of his things and blames people around him. He has verbally abused a lot of close friends around him accusing them of stealing his things, we repeatedly found his stolen items in his backpacks and other places3. He thinks someone has placed some sort of device in him that is allowing these ""people"" to talk with him in his head4. He constantly thinks his father-in-law (who is back in India) is colluding with a bunch of people here (like his employer, his roommates, and even some random guys in gym) to make his life miserable5. He thinks there is always someone (not just one person, every time it's someone different) who is always trying to sabotage him (ex: he thought someone was intentionally slowing down one of his servers at his work to sabotage his work, he blames that for his poor performance in his last job that he just lost).6. He talks to himself very often when he is with us, and he does that as soon as he enters restroom.We are all very worried about him. We want him to get help but he thinks there are no problems and that if he gets a little more fit all of this would go away.

Missing deadlines, managers saying I work in isolation and not working as a team which will affect my year end rating.

Apple,AayushRath,Stop overthinking about life and start practising self love.,"All of us at some point of time have:1) Looked at that couple at the supermart and at the guy and girl holding hands at the pub and wished about having a partner.2) Look at the folks post news about their new job and wish we get that coveted role.3) Look at young parents at playdates to always get reminded of your painful efforts to have children and fail so many times.4)Look at the guy who has the big house and then compare your small apartment for which you pay rent.I have seen people suffer from self esteem issues coz of this. Trust me, don't punish yourself for these stupid reasons. Don't be so harsh to yourself. Don't blame yourself nor your life. Life moves at different speeds for different people. Comparing yourself with others and indulging in self pity will only give you misery. Be easy on yourself. Love yourself and stop blaming your self for things that are not under your control.Look I am not trying to undermine your suffering. I'm not downplaying the seriouness of your problems. Im simply saying this self frustration and pity will kill you.Self love should be taught in schools. It is vital for a healthy life. Start giving yourself a break.

No hormonal changes (decent T levels to my knowledge but going to check this soon- I do it every year), and I’m into fitness and nutrition, and have a sports background so I can loose weight fast if I really want to unless my metabolism takes a dump! Slightly overweight, but I did start to get back to taking care of my physical health so I think I’ll loose the extra pounds soon, atleast by the end of the year.3. Not looking to date.

I feel like an errand boy who is there to help not just my partner but others in my family but no one really wants to support me/ understand me when i need them.Sometimes i feel like if i shut down more, maybe they will finally leave me, sometimes I intentionally miss my medicines for months because i don’t want to be a part of the future if it is like this.I get blamed for being depressed, disconnected, sad but no one really cares if i tell them that they are also a reason for that. I constantly get pushed for getting back on track but I don’t know if I can take anymore of it .(Yes, I am taking therapy / medicines and apparently. Whats funny is they keep asking me if i want to hurt myself, but seems like they are absolutely fine with me slowly killing myself by skipping my meds)I have been thinking about going on a solo trip but i am really afraid that i wont be able to come back to this life :(I just wish people left me for good because I don’t know how to end this without ending myself. I swear I am not a bad person and i know others aren’t too. I do feel that somehow their Wants are always prioritized over my Needs. I haven’t been able to maintain any connections / make new ones because I just feel full , afraid, overwhelmed.How do i know that ending my relationship is not a mistake? I have even admitted that I have become a person with no emotions who is constantly grumpy and i don’t think I even deserve to be in a relationship.Whats worse is that i am losing the will to become better , have things to look forward to as time goes by. My parter also knows i have been struggling but I still continue to find myself in those situations/triggers where it feels like someone just managed to ruin my mood completely for multiple hours/days (i swear its not under my control )#depression #mentalhealth",,10/1/2022,26,662,3,Family Issue,Depressed
Google,dogstack,Brilliant manager turns out to be two-faced and ineffective. Jump ship or wait it out?,"Started a new role ~4mo. ago and from the get-go, the expectations and goalposts have shifted for everyone else, and they've only increased for me. When I came on, I was hired with the presumption that I'd have the financial, logistical, and managerial support to build out and hire a robust team that I would then oversee while working on some of our larger initiatives.All of that has been yanked, and my manager's solution to this is to throw up her hands and say, ""Not my problem, I'm already doing so much for the team."" She is actively hurting my workflow and process. She pushes back on every single suggestion or idea I have, but maintains that we're equals in the decision-making process. Everything from when to take PTO, to requesting a shift in my meeting availability to earlier hours (""you're going to look lazy"") to basic tasks is constantly questioned. She wants emails sent documenting everything before, after, and during a project, even if it's as simple as a 1-day task. She is visibly distressed in meetings, a lot of eye-rolling, and has a tendency to give me fast, aggressive feedback in the middle of ongoing syncs. I've now had two external stakeholders privately reach out to me after meetings with her to check in on me and let me know that they think she's acting inappropriately when we speak.I am operating with about 5x the volume of daily work I have had at at any other org, and I have 22 long-term objectives that I am constantly asked to provide updates on, one of which includes managing a team of 10 on a two-year project, and usually, my updates are that I have scheduled time to allocate towards the project, but haven't kicked it off because the deadline falls after my other work. Her response to that is to tell me to prioritize it. Everything is an emergency and nothing is an emergency. She ends our conversations with some iteration of, ""It's just a job, don't be so stressed, stop making everything such a big deal,"" and has begun telling me, in writing, that she can't ""manage my emotions"" in response to me telling her that I feel like the workload is quickly reaching a tipping point. She will then rant for upwards of a half-hour that I'm not special for having these issues and that she has more stress and more visibility than I do. She's a fucking executive!In response to the comment on emotions, this feedback comes up whenever I bring anything up that I would like to either address directly or have her support in changing. I usually send an email outlining my thoughts and ideas, and I always preface and finish it by telling her that I defer to her ultimate discretion, but want to open the dialogue. I think I'm calm, communicate well, and use appropriate language. I don't know why she keeps telling me to manage my emotions, but it's affecting my confidence and it feels like inappropriate and non-actionable feedback.The worst part is that she will wrap up all our discussions with some sort of external compliment, like, ""And just so you know, I spoke to X board member/Y executive and everyone is incredibly pleased with your performance and nobody has any negative feedback for you."" So it's really her expectations that are impossible to meet, and she refuses to accept that as reality. She constantly says one thing and does another.It is important to note that English is not her first language (she is Italian) but she went to HBS, so she speaks excellently and knows how to comport herself around American staff. I'm at a loss as to what to do. I don't think they're going to fire me, but I'm having trouble sticking it out. It's literally my fourth month. I should be taking on more work, finishing my training, and planning long-term career objectives for myself, and I am in so much deeper with literally no recognition beyond, ""Thanks for that, let's move onto the next thing.""Things I like about this role: it's fully/flexibly remote, colleagues outside of this department are eager to help, I am earning more than I was before, and I am experiencing an incredibly diverse range of new skills and projects to the point where I feel like I could fill a whole page of my resume from the last few months alone.

Why would he join us, but to help out we asked what does he look like. And they said he will find us as he has seen us. We told them that we are leaving soon too, and they said he will be with you guys in your car.So we asked again what does he look like, to which we heard the most strange answer.They said he passed away last year and they were there to celebrate his birthday.And his soul told them that they will be joining us.We were freaking out at that moment but there was nothing that we could do.They left and we were alone at Mt Rainier.We made ourselves believe they were kidding and pranking with us.But since then we are feeling some moments / presence around us which we are not able to find reasoning to.Me and my date both heard our names being called and it wasn’t us.What should we do?We have been freaking out since then.#amazon#seattle",,10/17/2022,19,800,3,Family Issue,Others

New,lostc0der,No confidence after extended leave for health,"In 2020, out of nowhere, I was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma and had to take about 6 months off work to undergo chemo treatment. When it was time to go back to my old job, they'd called everyone back into the office and I couldn't risk it being I was immuno-compromised. I took a job with a friend's small, new company and it went well at first. Then, I became overwhelmed. It seems that my last job didn't prepare me for changes in the industry and the time off didn't help. It seems everyone started with K8s and AWS and I was completely lost. My background was in web dev. Mostly full-stack, but rather simple internal applications for government customers. I think the chemo did something to me cognitively as I have trouble understanding and even knowing the right questions to ask about technical things I don't understand now. I've tried online courses around AWS and K8s, but they're not making sense to me.I'm on my 3rd job since finishing chemo (I'm in complete remission btw) and am currently on leave because I got overwhelmed with what I was being asked to do. To be fair to myself, it's a very complex app that is requiring me to learn many new concepts (some of which are only applicable to the specific business logic and technology of the customer) and the person in charge is very inexperienced being in charge (and she'd much rather be coding than helping me). I'm generally very hard on myself (it's automatic to me) and when I can't understand something, it can be devastating. I think it's anxiety plus a bit of cognitive impairment from the chemo that has me in my current situation. I should also mention the fact that I haven't been myself since finishing chemo. I used to always have a side/personal project and I haven't had interest in that kind of thing (or really anything) since. I'll also mention I've been on multiple antidepressants/anti-anxiety pills and I'm currently undergoing ketamine treatment.I have another 3 weeks off before my FMLA ends and I'm wondering if I should go back to the same job or look for something else. I know I'll have to learn the K8s and AWS stuff eventually, but are there decent paying jobs that don't require it or require minimal interaction with them for now? Can I count on a similar TC going fully remote in the private sector?TL;DR:I feel like I don't have the right experience anymore and I'm having trouble learning new things due to anxiety and cognitive impairment from chemotherapy.I have another 3 weeks off before my FMLA ends and I'm wondering if I should go back to the same job or look for something else.

Aurora,jrhhxjso,"Sick of my ""friends""","They always try to compare themselves with me or each other as if life is a zero sum game. No one really cared about lending support or bothered comforting me when I opened up to them about a personal problem recently, some went as far as poking fun at my expense.Some can't handle it upon hearing news of others' success like a promotion or a new job -- while they don't make it known, the jealousy is pretty clear from the body language. They enjoy times when others receive career related bad news, and never actually offer support.I'm fucking sick of them, do I just burn all these bridges? It's a pretty toxic circle and I don't see any value in continuing our ""friendships"" if it's going to be so one sided.

I don’t hate the women who reject me because if they had any sense, they wouldn’t pick someone like me, so I don’t blame them.And this might sound pathetic to most of you here but I have two major accomplishments in life:1) I don’t have any kids to ruin their lives2) I got a job at Amazon, which I know many of you scoff at.That’s all I got to say before I talk in circlesTC: 185",185000,7/15/2022,48,1050,8,Family Issue,Therapy

Meta,eFHm32,Have you ever felt let down by parents?,"I grew up in a tier 2 city in India. I didn’t grow up poor, but lower middle class. We had enough to fulfill all the basic necessities and my parents gave me the best education they could find in my city.Almost all of my father’s brothers were corrupt government officials, who had more disposable income than my dad. My mom had a decent job, but my dad made her quit her job. Not sure if this was the reason, but my dad was always insecure and tried to maximize savings. Today, in spite of our family doing relatively well financially, it is never enough for him and always wants more. I helped out my parents and my brother financially for the better part of a decade, back when I was not earning as much as I am today. My dad has never been grateful and always expects more money from me. When I noticed that he has not always been truthful, and has enough money in fixed deposits I cut off the money I was sending. I still help them out with gifts sometimes, but I have avoided giving any cash for the last year.This experience has made me question a lot of things about my upbringing. Like most Indian families, education was the most important thing growing up and trumped everything else. My dad was never involved in my studies day to day, but was the first to question and taunt me when I scored less than expected in an exam or didn't score amongst the top percentile in competitive exams. The importance long-term goals, emotional intelligence, dealing with failures, and growing up as an adult with good values and morals were never discussed.He does not hold a good opinion about anyone. He talks nice to people in front of them and talks ill about them behind their backs. He is never happy to see someone else succeed, his default reaction is to be jealous. These, among other things, normalized a lot of bad personalities for me.My dad was a caring parent and he still loves me, but I feel let down by the parenting I received.Throughout my life, I have chased money at the cost of constant stress and anxiety. I’m 30 now, and I am trying to be a very different person for the rest of my life.",,9/30/2022,18,594,8,Indians Issue,Stress

IBM,👁🐝 M,Online gaming addiction,"I’ve been struggling with online gaming addiction for more than a decade. During school days I would stay up all night and procrastinate, then if there is an exam or something due I would fake a stomach virus to get an extension then finish it very sloppily while I’m waiting for my game to start/queue. For work I would also do the minimum required and didn’t strive for excellence like I’m supposed to, being competitive and all.I’ve gone to an addiction clinic and a psychiatrist where all what the workers knew were alcoholism and gambling addictions, but they saw this as far less serious and their advice was short-lived at best, except for when my psychiatrist told me to be more forgiving to myself, and this always helps.I’ve uninstalled my games hundreds of times and deleted my accounts worth thousands of dollars and thousands of hours, but I just end up recreating accounts and reinstalling games.I have a great family but I hide this from them because it caused a lot of friction in our past and I don’t want to reopen any wounds.I’ve been in multiple relationships, tried to keep myself busy with sports, religion, finances, etc but I always end up back where I started. I feel like I’m out of options and that I’m soulbound to this addiction. I’ve tried all kinds of (non-hard) drugs and was a heavy smoker but I’m always able to beat all of their cravings, but gaming is a different monster…I am not expecting real advice from the Blind community that would actually help me, but just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is in the same boat, as misery loves company…150,3",,9/12/2022,28,760,3,Family Issue,Others

What kind of support structure helped you the most? What do I need to do as a parent to make sure I'm supporting my daughter the best I can? I also worry about me dying these days because that means my daughter will have to fend for herself. My close friends and family don't understand autism and don't try very hard to understand it.

I do my best to support him but nothing helps. I am a naturally confident person but his insecurities make me doubt myself too. I look at him and I am trying to see a bright person I once met and fell in love with, but the more he speaks about how big of a loser he is, the more I see him as a loser.I dont know how to help him, I used all the possible resources.

My family has a Whatsapp group and of course everyone still expects me to be all happy. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy for them, because this infertility sucks big time, but I am very sad for me.

My husband is quite supportive but he's not the cry on my shoulder type person. He believes I should stop thinking about it and while I get that, it's been 6 years. Kind of very difficult not to worry about it.It's really beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I have random episodes of bathroom crying at work, church and at home.

LexisNexis,oikos,"Some of my learnings, for you to build on!","TLDR;- nobody knows your life/situation better than yourself, so stop expecting that others' suggestions will magically solve your problems- to improve yourself, you must have self-discipline in life- if you can't stop negative habits cold turkey, phase them out slowly.- if you go back to old bad habits, ack it, forgive yourself and start over again.- cope with the feeling of not being good enough by thinking you will always be behind in some aspects in every version of you- play with the cards you are dealt with. Not everyone is born with the same resources, so don't try to compare with others.To me, tomorrow, and anyone out there who needs help figuring out things like me. If life were social media, and you're posting stuff about your life, and every interaction you have, is a comment on your post. Most likely, the top comments would seem like they don't want to help you but just point out the mistakes you already know about, especially when you go ""wrong."" Which, by the way, is subjective. In my view, the world doesn't know where it's going, let alone your first, second, and third connections. Yes, it's difficult. No one quite understands what you're going through. Nor will anyone. Ever. And that's okay. It's your life. You are what you are because you've made some decisions in the past that has led you to this moment. Everyone; leads a different life. No matter how much they try to fit theirs into a framework that is tried and tested. Yet, there will always be aspects where you can't. Simply because life is a multivariate equation to which variables keep getting added. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by these variables, I would suggest starting small with simple things. Start simple by making a to-do list of things you wish to do. Work-wise, or otherwise. Start maybe with a schedule. That you want to get to, or may be, need to. You're sleeping at 3? Set a reminder on your phone to help you sleep at 2. Start with small changes to your current schedule. Whatever works. Start with meditation apps like balance or headspace and see if you can follow them. If you stop doing it after a week. Two weeks. A month. That's okay! Acknowledge that you've stopped. Admit your mistakes. Learn from those and restart again after a week. Failed to list out your to-dos? That's okay! Acknowledge, learn, and implement. Realize that accountability is a good aspect of what working in an industry is all about, or for that matter, your life too. Every commit you make. Every word you speak. Every email you write. Every message you send. Every ounce of water is used. Every watt of electricity you consume. There's a sense of accountability associated with that. Take a moment, and acknowledge it. Can't start work-wise? Start otherwise. Cook your food on time. Set a cleaning schedule for your apartment. Start off small with your room. Start off even small with your desk. Start off even smaller. Have a bath. Start off even smaller. Brush your teeth.If you make mistakes, that is okay. I only say it's okay because I don't have to pay for them. I already did. You will have to. When you realize that, your inner self will want to do better. What no one tells you is life is a process, and so is everything within it. No one is good at everything every time. Some have learned to focus on some things. Just because they didn't have to worry about other things. Some, who've always had money, just had to study. People with money and good skills had to stay persistent with their learning. People without means had to gain those means, study, and work while managing everything simultaneously. If anything, in my view, people who've struggled the most have learned the most in life, have a much more holistic view of what life is about, and steadily improve themselves while living their life, without maybe even realizing it. In my view, total compensation is an excellent way to feel good about yourself because you live what you've learned. So, it may be that all you've learned in this capitalistic society we live in is that if you make good money, you're successful. But what we fail to understand is we live a reality we've created for ourselves. Collectively and individually. Don't beat yourself with a bat, but recognize that we've also chosen our reality. If we don't work hard for it, no one will work hard for us. In the end, it's a game of survival. The fittest survive. If you don't learn that, your future self will have to eventually learn that. Seems to me that you may be at that stage. So recognizing, which you have, is the first step, so congratulations! Some people might still not have recognized that. So you're ahead on the curve in some aspects. And way behind on some. And that's okay. Every version of you will always play a ""catch-up"" game. For that compensation. For that company. For that promotion. For love. For family. For friends. For happiness. For tranquility. And that's okay. Once you recognize that your today is resting on all your yesterdays. And all your tomorrows are resting on your todays. You'll be most likely to start working on all your todays. So start wherever you feel like you need to. Have this talk with yourself. Have this talk with yourself every day. Until you feel like you've achieved what these other people with hefty compensation have either had the privilege to have it easy. Or for the people who've worked very hard. Both of them will say the same thing. Some... with more arrogance than others. Some, with vague statements. And some with a step-by-step guideline. And some, like me, just rambling on for days. 🤣 Sorry, this post made you sleep. But it’ll still be here when you wake up.Know that you'll never be good at everything, most probably, anything, and that's okay. In the end, all we can do is try.So, where possible, try harder.——Another thing, that I want to say about this platform about the culture of “TC or GTFO” is a little unclear to me. The median worldwide income is about $10,000. The median US income is about $32,000, so seems to me we’re already in the top 1% of the world depending on whom you talk with.I earn about $90,000, recently, a few days ago, I felt the need to lie on this platform, and I deleted this same post after a few minutes.I felt like I needed to be heard. And TC was a good way to go about it. I knew when I started working, that I’m already in the top 1% of the world. But I think I pressured my own self to lie, to make sure I’m heard. I’m understood. That this reaches the folks who, like me might need help making sense of the chaos we’re in. Turns out you can learn a thing or two pretty quickly, if you spend some time learning about yourself.Also, my manager has promoted me, so this figure will change in a week or two. Hoping to cross the 100k mark.Also, YOE is about 2. I’m new to everything. So now, it’s okay if some find my thinking naive. I think, I’m just too full of myself to care about, what some think about. But you, I care about. Enough, to try and share my learnings with you, so you can build on them, for yourself. Also, this a post to me too when I go astray. So don’t feel too special. 😂I’m 25 years old and a work in progress. So help me improve or GTFO.And no, I didn’t write this to make myself feel good. Some of this was my comment to a post, “an unavoidable professional mistake”, that was trending. Figured I’ve spent too much time on this, to turn it into a post. Hope it helps.——Edit 1: you think you’re sitting behind a wall with comments. Trying to be funny. And let me tell you, you are. But I think I see you, just a shadow of you.

I'm flying my sister family, mine, and my partner out for our wedding... bad timing.In reading through the pivot document, it looks like im being dinged for lacking in Bias for Action.

I never tell anyone, but i try to be very transparent about what i'm doing and course correct when i go too deep or wide into a distraction.

In the pivot he says we've been working together, but never gave indication of things going off the rails until he says, ""i wish this was done sooner"". Now the improvement plan has an increased scope and a new project. So, i start spiraling without clear priorities.I feel Amazon role guidances don't accommodate for neurodiversity.

They openly feared being judged for not raising me well, not sure if there is some guilt with my dad.- all this motivated me to get out, passed out from good universities, got good job after undergrad, fought hard and self funded myself for postgrad- married my childhood best friend. This one was easy after I fought hard to not marry anyone and keeping my spouse a secret until I told them.-parents into spirituality or claim too as they oscillate between being there for relatives and sometimes going cold and avoiding all.- marriage caused the first rift as they felt like losing control over me, they did not agree to most of the arrangements even though I was paying for the wedding myself. Spouse family took upon rest of the arrangements after much resistance from my family.-Post marriage my parents oscillated between talking to me and ghosting me for months if I had disagreements.- I was asked to donate money for spirituality and simply not question anything. I was given a shopping list often that I should not question or I will be called out for being ungrateful and arrogant-I focused on my spouse and was too happy to ignore all this. The 4 weeks I visited them was misery - kicked out of home, publicly insulted before relatives and in laws.- I decided that they are better off without me in their life and was only entertaining communication when pleasant.- Applied for visa to have them visit me. They stood me up at visa appointment day. Managed to get them into another appointment.- I got pregnant and was expecting mom and dad here and they were taunting and ghosting me during pregnancy.- Had a whole series of problems from in laws but my family chose to gossip with them. They are more close now.-Agreed to visit me 3months postpartum. They apologized for ghosting often and intended to be there for me. Later they mentioned they were pressurized by relatives and in laws to show up.- 1 month into staying with us. I was nursing, constantly hungry and irritable. They were criticizing how we did things and not following covid safety. Every fight i took a breather to sleep over it and hoped next day would be fine. I had so much frustration built up that I openly discussed how they have treated me over the years during those fights.- end of first month they wanted to attend a religious gathering and we did not agree for covid safety for them and our 3month old.-they take relatives help to book return tickets to home country. I was nursing and they just walk out of the house one morning.

Amazon,spacebass,Skip told me the team was better when I was gone,"Posting for a friend, they work at a start up not at Amazon.I’ve been at this company for 4.5 years and have been promoted 3 times.So two days ago, members of another team were asking my opinion about a design aspect of our website. I gave my opinion and they disagreed so I explained my opinion again and they ultimately still disagreed so I said “ok I’m just giving my recommendation”Then at 10pm that night I get a very stern message from my skip telling me that I’m “fighting” on everything with this other team and it’s the last thing our company needs right now and I’m directly driving down the company’s ARR….I lost a lot of sleep thinking about what I said and what to say back because I was honestly in shock since I’m not a very confrontational person at all.So yesterday I tell my skip I’m confused and want to set up a call to understand.On the call my skip starts by saying “it’s very concerning if you don’t think what you said yesterday was causing unnecessary friction.” This shocked me again and I explained I had no intention at all to cause unnecessary friction.I asked if this is something to consider as a formal warning and they said no, but then they went on to say “the team was better when you were gone” - referring to me being out on a long period of PTO recently.I told them I would appreciate not receiving these messages at 10pm, to just message me during work hours about such concerns, and my skip said “ok that’s good feedback”To top it off I asked if they read the message thread directly and they said they did not. So later I set up a call with the coworker who complained to my skip and they said they really don’t have any problems with me but that one conversation made them slightly uncomfortable because I was digging my heels in the sand.I’m not sure what to do? I feel incredibly insulted and don’t think my skip should speak to me or anyone else like this. Should I talk to my direct manager? HR?

Apple,wannabean,Spouse wants hoodie,"We got some new swag for our team (~25ish people?). We had to put in our sizes months ago and they all just arrived. We also got a SWE shirt on the same day, so I decided to be nice and get the shirt in my wife's size so she'd have something too.She hated the shirt and loved the hoodie. Decided I should take them both back and swap them for the other sizes.But in my mind it just doesn't work like that. She wants me to ask my bosses boss if they have a spare small ladies hoody so I can swap my hoodie for that one, after they put together this swag thing for the (newish) team. This request is frying my brain and just doesn't make sense to me at all.I'll often freeze up at stuff like this, my wife tells me to do something that doesn't make sense and I just can't comprehend how I'd actually go about doing that.. Like I'm brain locked. I guess basically I'm just not comfortable at all making that sort of request especially given the current team dynamics and what not. I'm certainly not in ""bro mode"" with the bosses boss to be all like ""yo, any hoodies left over for my wife"" (if I'm ever like that.. I'm not like that).Often times what she asks me to do makes sense when you think about it a certain way, but I just can't get in the right mindset with this request..Anyway, this time I just told her no, I'm not even going to ask. She chucked a colossal tanty and smashed the bread tin she was holding repeatedly on the floor, dinting it, then spent a while trying to bang it back out again with the meat pounder getting angrier and angrier (presumably at me for making her wreck her bread tin).Now she is stone-walling me and the only thing she will say is ""let me know when you hear back about the hoodie"".As background we've just gone through a period where she stone-walled me for 3 months, and things were just getting better. I've been working hard to compliment her and make sure she is happy. Then suddenly this comes out of no where.I don't know, I'm just even more uncomfortable now. It is kinda tearing me up, on the one hand it is ""just a question"", and it would make my wife happy to ask even if the answer is no.

It became obvious that my manager didn’t really know much about the work that had to be done but would act like she did.On top of this, the client that we were working with was also really difficult and would freak out over the smallest things. Plus they would constantly tell us to change the way we would do our work.All this led to an extremely stressful work environment where you felt like you were walking on eggshells.Eventually, I decided that I had enough and resigned after 5 months. This was the first time in my young professional life that I felt that work was affecting my mental health.

I want to hear your stories and some commiseration so I feel less alone, and I'm interested in who you spoke to at work about it. I'm in the USA (Baltimore-Washington area), which makes employees with mental health conditions a protected class.10 years ago I was diagnosed with ""Bi-polar major depression with generalized anxiety disorder"". I take a fist full of medicine every day to control it, which keeps things in check most of the time. On top of that, I take two additional meds to control my weight* (quite successfully I might add).Here's the problem: the gray matter isn't working too well. I lose track of what I'm talking about frequently, I feel like I'm in a fog, focus is virtually nonexistent, and I've lost the ability to care about the companies I've worked for over the last few years.As a result, I keep resigning and bouncing around. I want to leave where I am now after three months, but I'm starting to think that is mental health related. I don't even have the motivation to work on my personal pet projects. For what it's worth, I have a good family life, get plenty of fresh air and go for walks often. 90% of my stressors are work related. The rest is trying to get out of doing the dishes.I'm not sure if I can hold down a job that doesn't involve serving french fries for too long anymore until things are resolved. That can take months to ramp up and ramp down different meds while we find the balance. In the meantime, I just continue my daily shitload of pills and do my best to help out my teams.I'm actively working with my doctors about this, but I'd really like to hear people in similar situations. Did you tell HR? Your manager? File for disability and take some time to get your shit together?Thanks in advance!*Since someone will ask, the weight meds are wegovy and phentermine.

Back in college when I was around 20-21 , I proposeda girl, she thanked but rejected stating she always saw me as a good friend and was not seriously looking for a relationship as she wants to focus on her career. I couldn’t take that and constantly troubled her by texting to impress her (never crossed my limits though). She handled the situation in a very mature way and tried helping me out rather than making a scene out if it, so great of her. I later stopped troubling her after a while and we became good friends but I felt I shouldn’t trouble her anymore and never tried contacting her (blocked her and many mutual friends) and she too moved on. Fast forward 8-9 years since that incident , I am still single, unable to like/get any other girl , struggling to get into a big tech firm. These 8-9 years was never a cake walk. I toiled hard even for minor career progressions and there were only few occasional personal and professional happy incidents/victories. My life is much better than what it was 7-10 years ago but still the growth isn’t extraordinary when compared to many of my peers who work/worked/working less than me and having better Satisfaction/TC both from a personal and professional perspective. I sometimes feel that few people try to intentionally hurt me although they are good and helpful most other times. There was one recent miracle (by god’s grace)that happened from a work perspective recently but I fought tooth and nail to get it done so that I could meet my household expenses. I completed my masters 2 years ago and still don’t have solid savings. I never felt bad for that as I thought it was my responsibility as a son to take up some responsibilities but expect to have some savings even after meeting those expenses which is doable at a bit more higher pay. I got some better offers but none of them were great long term options.

Had to beg them to convert my internship to full -time.

I graduated from college ~7-8 months ago, and finally had my first job as a manufacturing engineer.My job requires me to interact with the workers on the production floor in order to get their opinions and feedback for projects. Within the first 3 months of starting, I had been called pet names and questioned about my skills. Some of these workers even tried to pursue me. Things got awkward and uncomfortable when I drew the line.None of the male interns and co-op experience this issue. Their skills are never questioned. They aren’t called sweetie and sweetheart.My mental health has declined rapidly, and I wake up each morning dreading work. I avoid interacting with the workers now to avoid such issues again, and it’s hindering my work. I talked to management and HR about the issue, and it helped a bit.I’m actively browsing job sites to find new opportunities because I’m so fucking sick of this.In college I never really understood why retention for women in stem was an issue.

Thank you to the people who understands my situation and are supportive 😊!To clarify some things:1. I wanted to share about my experience and how that helped me understand why some women leave stem.It also helps to bring awareness to the difficulties women have to face in a male dominated field.2. My job is a 50/50 split between design and manufacturing, so my time is split between the office and the production floor. My title is just manufacturing engineer. I still have to deal with these things in the office. It’s just a different flavor. On multiple occasions, my male colleague has tried to take credit for my work during design reviews or mansplain my own projects to me. The manufacturing side is worse, so I only talked about that.Definitely, it’s not because it’s “manufacturing”. I’m pretty sure all women have to deal with sexist bs like this at some point in their career. My friends in tech have shared similar stories with me.3. Pursued was me labeling borderline harassment nicely. It’s creepy when a worker texts you repeated and jokes about calling you until you pick up the phone. Or when they constantly invite you over their place or try to get involved in your activities. And it’s obviously soooooo flattering when a married man with kids is trying to flirt and ask you on a date. It’s not flattering like some of you might think. It’s a distraction and annoyance for work. I just want to get my work done, not get my cheeks clapped.TC: 69k",69000,1/11/2022,103,4383,79,Indians Issue,Others
Apple,renter4lyf,Victim mentality,"No work this week, so here’s a poll. Do you have a victim mentality (possibly being from yelled at and told no too many times in childhood, etc.)?For example:Buying shit stocks/coins in hopes of getting rich. And when they fail you feel good for being right about the fact that the world treats you badly and that you are a victimPassing up on good opportunities/people and choosing situations that could potentially get shitty because shitty situations are what you secretly are comfortable with and think you deserveNot fighting for what you deserve because you think that you are a victimEtc.Of course it would be wrong to post this without providing a solution.

Meta,enbm16,Former manager ruined my mental health,"Hi all,Has anyone ever had their mental health/wellbeing destroyed by an utterly awful boss? Although I'm at a new company and so much happier now, I'm still so resentful about the way I was treated at my former company by my manager. It was so bad that I had a massive mental breakdown (exploded from burnout) and had to be put on an antidepressant/sleep meds for the severe anxiety caused by my boss.I was doing well, and my original boss (who hired me, and we got along great) left. Still continued to do well after their departure. My new manager came along, and didn't like me and finally made my life hell/managed me out. Never had negative feedback from original boss/leadership/xfn partners. So, I got let go, and had to take a few months off to recover and build back my self esteem. I couldn't take FMLA because I wasn't there long enough (company policy). I even reached out to HR, they didn't do anything, even though they claimed my manager's behavior was unacceptable. I learned here that HR is never on your side.Additionally, why is it SO hard to sue employers for causing us this much distress? I sincerely hope all bad managers out there burn in hell. And if you're a shitty manager who makes your direct reports' lives miserable, you don't belong in a leadership position. Just because you suffered and ass kissed to get to where you are, doesn't mean you have to stomp on others below you. Good grief.It astounds me by how much shitty bosses get away with.Anyways fam, for those struggling, it WILL get better. Quit that toxic job, if you can. Take the time off, if you can. More importantly, believe in yourself, and keep your head up. Life is too short to be negatively affected by the workplace. You will end up in a better place in no time.

I’m too embarrassed to even type how dirty his room can get, spoke to him about this and he said ‘that’s your problem if the state of the apartment bothers you,not mine’ which makes me wonder if he even cares about me at all. He says he will change but I don’t think I can wait around hoping to see if that is really going to happen. I really do care about the guy but sometimes I feel that he just doesn’t care enough to put in any effort or maybe he’s just too comfortable and takes me for granted.

Here are a few symptoms and impacts even while working from home. Please add or clarify to the ones below.1. Sleeplessness and insomnia - impacts ability to focus and concentrate on work and in meetings due to poor sleep . Trouble concentrating2. Heart palpitations - unable to sit still in a chair or confined space3. Panic attacks at random times during the day - susceptible to having this triggered multiple times during work engagements4. Anxiety - unable to drive a car on the road - impacts getting to and coming home from work or work related engagements5. Depression and fatigue - exhaustion and muscle aches - no capacity or ability to care for oneself. Dependent on family for basic care and maintenance.Are the above reasons sufficient to warrant and justify short term disability for mental health - as limitations impacting performance at a high profile manager or director level job .

They are not my ""real friend"" either, why do I bother though, maybe not helping others = not a good person mindset was once cultivated and rooted deeply in my mind. My two sides are conflicting one another always.These kinds of interactions with my friend are consuming my energy intrinsically, I really want to have a more positive/productive/energetic change.I know this sounds naive or immature, but wondering if any of SDEs/professional have such similar feeling, and any suggestions on overcome this kind of mindset.What's the correct attitude/thinking pattern should I have?#sde #swe #se #engineer #career #job #it #professional #work #mentalhealth #mindset #attitude #burnout #depressionTC 165K",165000,11/21/2022,10,251,1,Burnout,Burnout

For some reason he makes a sudden move, and I reflexively slouch and pull my head deep into my shoulders. He notices that.— Are you afraid of me?As usually, on the escalator he stands two steps lower than me. He takes a carefully folded plastic bag from the inner pocket of his winter jacket and we put there our hats, scarfs, and gloves. Mixed feelings. This ritual has always seemed to me reasonable yet a bit excessive. I have never seen anyone else doing this, which makes it both special and weird. He hates putting stuff in the pockets, because he hates sagging pockets. But I love it. I want everything necessary for my survival to be in my pockets. So that I could always run and have my hands free.— Are you afraid of me?I freeze. But somehow, I cannot lie. Weird. Why? It almost feels like like a point of no return. Now or never. My eyes begin to fill with tears. If I hesitate for another few seconds, I will start crying. This will only make things worse. My voice is trembling but I silently say— Yes.I don’t want to deal with whatever comes next. God, I beg, take my soul. Fastforward to the next life.— But why, you know that I love you?Tears keep coming in. Deep inside, the suppressed anger goes berserk on a tight leash. A deep breath. I make a tremendous effort and do my best focusing entirely on the part of me, which knows that he loves me. He actually does.— Yes.— Then why?For the fuck sake, he won’t let up. Is he an idiot? Am I an idiot? Well, according to him — yesterday — I am the idiot. Yesterday...Snot runs from my nose. Mixes with tears somewhere around chin. His hand is behind the back of my head. I know precisely where it is. I cringe. I freeze. My breath stops. My heart slows down. Now would be a good moment for the slap. Please, now. I cannot stay like that anymore. And I surely cannot convert the fuckin time from AM to 24. God bless, the slap comes. Not that bad actually. The best thing is that I finally have the moral right to cry. I feel relieved and relatively safe for a while. “Idiot! Is it actually that difficult to add twelve to seven??” I sob. I gasp. What goes through my head at this moment? Well, I wish he experienced what I experience now. Also... it’s strange but for some reason, while I am sure that I don’t want to have kids — just like I don’t want to have siblings (and kids, who do, seem quite stupid to me) — but if I ever... I swear, I won't ever lay a finger on them. Never, never, never! No matter what they do. In the morning we wake up nearly simultaneously. His bed is behind the top of my chair-bed but I can hear his breath. I can distinguish all the variations of his breathing. “I am sorry about yesterday.” Oh? That’s new. I am alert. I have no response for this. “But... admit it, that was quite stupid of you yesterday to struggle that long with these dumb conversions”. Ah, now I see. I cringe. I tighten the leash.— Mmm?My brain is furiously performing calculations. Optimization. Estimation. Potentially a good problem for near-term quantum devices, as I will think a quarter century later. Parallel realities evolve in my brain. They entangle, rotate, and compete against each other. Aight, done. The chances of escalation in the absence of response are estimated to be low. Good.

NVIDIA,CVvm07,How to stop seeking approval from others and comparing each other?,"Hey folks,There was a recent post about telling TC to your family and this post brought up another problem for me, so I hope you can share your thoughts and help me.I've faced the issue that since I started working at big tech my salary became from x2 to x10 comparing to parents & friends. Always wanted to share this with them to find the approval or getting applauses like ""OMG, that's huge, you are awesome!"" or to get theirs salary as a feedback and feel better because my compensation would be higher (aka comparing each others success).I had a dozen of cases in the last years when I disclosed the compensation and ... nothing happened. I was so disappointed every time of their poor reactions like ""Ok, nice"" and the insight came to me that this is freaking wrong to seek for an approval or comparing with others to feel better.I was raised in modest family, but my father (73 y.o) was always jealous about money and dependent on this because he was rich in his 20s-30s bragging about this. He has several sons and a lot of time he is dreaming of us sending him money so he can live better (that's what he told me). He even has this bloody appreciation of having big-big car to sit higher in the traffic so people will look at him with more respect or dreaming of all the sons coming to his house on the big cars all together so the neighbors could see this and be jealous of him (wtf, it's mental, right?).I'm tired of seeing growing the same within me. How to stop being dependent on money, success and comparing with each other?Speaking of approvals, I also have a problem if my manager is not giving positive feedback to me in a more verbose manner than ""Thanks, good work"". Especially if it's freaking 2-3 months of rush when the tasks were stated as ""should be done yesterday!"".My manager is more tech than people manager - he didn't want to be a manager, that's what he told me, he just had to pass the knowledge to someone to scale and work more. So the level of his emotional intellect is quite low. All the people management problems he treats as ""tasks"" with description, steps to do and scope of responsibilities. I don't think that I'll ever get something more than ""thanks"".How do you stop looking for approvals from managers/peers and start finding the recognition from yourself so you can be independent and rely only on yourself?TC: 154K$, IC3 in European country where the average salary is 6-12K$ a year, big tech salary is around 40-60K$ a year for IC3 and 60-100K$ for IC4.YOE: 6#mentalhealth #money #tc #approval #success #burnout #depression",154000,8/9/2022,28,528,5,Family Issue,Burnout

Microsoft,dhxjd,Slowly dying inside,"Hello Blind community!I’m an adult in my late-twenties and as I write this, I’m contemplating if my life is worth living. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, and l lost a lot of friends as a result. I broke up with my then gf about 4 years ago, and I still miss her. Partly bc of the way I treated her. I was an absolute mess. Bullets were fired from both the sides, and we decided to part ways. I’ve dated a bunch of girls after that, none of them worth pursuing I felt. I was mentally stuck. I needed a closure and I was still missing my ex (who I’ve known for close to 6 years when we parted ways). Most of my friends sided with her when we parted ways leaving me alone. I’d like to think I’m a changed man today, 4 years later, but there’s nothing I can do to fix the mess I made back then.I feel miserable for the things I did and said. I feel ashamed and want to take back all the words. Every single one of them. I’ve tried doing a lot of things to try to fix it, not bc I wanted to be with her but bc I wanted to feel better inside. I’m disgusted and feel like I don’t deserve to be alive.Maybe I’m exaggerating; maybe I’m not. We had an amazing run until I found out she wasn’t being honest. It broke me. I was young and stupid and didn’t know how to control my emotions. I really loved her with all my heart, I was all over the place and I fucked up.I never would say or do anything like that today. Now when I think back, I feel awful and ashamed and think about how I could’ve handled things better. It’s not the breakup that hurts, it’s how things ended that bothers me to this day. Wish I could go back and rewrite part of it, but I sadly cannot.Fast forward to today, I’ve never disrespected a living soul after the breakup. I’ve started from scratch and made new friends and tried rebuilding my life. I’m happy but still can’t make peace with the fact that I’ve been an asshole in the past, and it hurts to see great friends turn cold.I cry myself to sleep at times, I’ve considered taking my life a hundred times but then think of my parents. I’ve tried every trick in the book to forget my past and work on bettering myself but at times I feel lonely and my mind takes me back to where I don’t want to be.You can be as harsh as you’d like or roast me on here, bc I deserve it. I know I’m a changed man inside. But I still can’t make peace with how things ended between us. I could’ve shown a better version of myself. I didn’t.How can I move on and forget what’s happened in the past? Do I deserve a second chance? I ponder over these questions all the time and I happen to have no answers.I don’t have anybody I can open up to and share this with, hence leaning on my community. I’m slowly dying inside and I don’t know how to turn my life around! :(I’ve tried a lot of things and tried pursuing a hobby. I fall back midway bc I don’t have the motivation to keep at it. I have a decent job and make good $$$ but my life is at the lowest point and I don’t think me dying would make any difference to anybody. I’m not a likable person, I guess? No matter how much I try at times, I feel like no one around me likes me.The only thing keeping me alive is the hope that tomorrow will be better.Thanks for taking out the time to read this.#mentalhealth #depression",,6/19/2022,39,1444,10,Family Issue,Sad

Guaranteed Rate,DaveStuzin,I stopped using social media except for Blind and LinkedIn,"Before the change, I found myself scrolling endlessly and not really getting anything out of it except for the occasional meme or super annoying political post with no nuance and no depth.I never got into TikTok because it just seemed like mental illness app-sonified. I didn’t get into Twitter because the short form content doesn’t incentivize constructive conversation—it incentivizes clap back culture. Im also gettin pretty close to deleting LinkedIn because the content on there is becoming just as annoying.I took a hiatus for a little over a month. And I feel like my life is better for it. I feel less distracted, less annoyed, less drawn into my phone every few seconds.When I first tried it, I deleted the apps from my phone and found myself constantly going back to where the app was just out of reflex and it felt so weird when the app just wasn’t there. I found myself doing the same thing with the Facebook web app on my computer.I will occasionally go back to the accounts to catch up on DMs, but I delete the application as soon as I do.I don’t think that everyone needs to permanently delete social media apps, but I think you’ll feel better if you try it for like 30 days.I don’t think Blind falls under this category because everything is anonymous. I will change my username at some point and no one will ever be able to connect back to me. There is no real clout, just TC bragging. Which whatever, who even knows if it’s real?I recommend that if you feel distracted or feel like you spend too much time on social media, take a 30 day hiatus, delete the apps, log out of the web apps, and see if you feel like your life is better for it.#Socialmediadetox #mentalhealth",,6/26/2022,25,613,21,Others,Mental Health

I may have chosen to ignore their fights over years but now I realize it has been passively impacting me. Every evening when I talk to them I only hear about the fights. It’s always about a petty fight and repetitive. I also tried to reduce my regular conversations but then I was taken through an emotional guilt trip of depriving my parents of talking with them. I love them a lot but I’m just going crazy and I cannot resolve their marital problems. Hell I’m no therapist and seems like I will need one. At times I feel like telling them that they should have separated long ago. Living together and arguing daily is helping no one. But coming from a typical mindset I will be tortured to even suggest that. I love my parents and they are great individuals who have raised and provided me with the best they could. But I can’t handle this toxicity anymore. I dunno if I’m being selfish here. It’s affecting my mental health, my career and my personal life.

If you're competent, people assume you're brilliant. If you were able to prove you're competent, then that means you're brilliant. Don't let your self esteem suffer due to semantics.They're all related to one thing that unites us:Feeling powerless sucks. Not being rewarded sucks. Not being listened to sucks. Not being heard and validated sucks. Not being able to connect sucks. Not having a position of power you're immune from all of this.... sucks. And the bigger your perception of power, the more it sucks, and the dumber it makes you.Getting promoted doesn't make you lose IQ points, it makes your performance decoupled from your job security. That's why leaders need power more than juniors. They're actually more dumb now.Your stress levels rising because you're powerless at your job: you have no discretion or control over your work, doesn't mean you're dumb forever- it means you feel helpless and that makes you FEEL incompetent.You're competent.

Snap,Woodkid,It’s so easy to be a B player,"TL;DR - Learnt the hard way it best to be a B player than a high performing A player.I mean most of our tech jobs are pointless anyways. Unless you’re working for top secret federal agencies or ACTUAL game changing startup your work would have no impact on the real world.With that said, why bust ass an A player when you get the same amount of money per hour at way lesser stress as B player. Just be a B player knob shine and you’re set for life.Two of my ex colleagues were promoted to engineering manager and staff engineer just because I had a fall out with my previous manager. Although this was at an utterly stupid toxic company. They promoted them in spite and my director thought they’re as capable as me and “rewarded” them to stay… when the reality is that they’ve failed every interview with the companies I referred them to and no sane company would hire them.Being an A player you want to grow fast and make impactful work so when you come across slackers or toxic people that try to steal your work you either fight and win or leave… both of which are stressful. And it’s almost always the latter option that’s sensible in the long run.Even in good companies most of the folks who are calling the shots are the ones who joined early and sucked it up and don’t allow for newer talent to grow in any way that would threaten their comfort space. So they hire and promote mediocre subservient folks and company grows to a point when it becomes another failed boomer company.There’s no fucking concept of meritocracy anymore!!Rant over.

I was always an introvert but still always had at least a few people around me.The last few years have been really difficult and each year I feel like the previous year was better.Everything was really great at work but now the anxiety is holding me back and I am at a stage where I am no longer able to drag myself to work every single day. I want to take a break but this fucking visa, the therapist who I have been talking to for months now, doesn't think I should take more than a 2-week break(well knowing that it was so difficult for me to come back to work as my last 3-week break was about to end). I am ready to pack my bags and go home and just do nothing for some time, but I can not do that for at least a few months because of a few ongoing things.

New,hdydi,Originals way to cop with depression,"Tc :200k (stonks only go up 😪)Unfortunately it’s pretty common to see mental health threads on blind.With this thread, Im hoping we can explore methods to cop with depression other than the usually recommended low hanging fruits.In short : early 30’ M, covid has been devastating socially as my only few good friends moved out of the city, and I have been single for the last 2 years. Lack of frequent social interactions and degraded mental health is slowly turning me into a weirdo despite being decent looking and having been « cool » earlier in my life. I’m afraid that I wont turn this around given my age.Depression in my case started about 20 months ago out of isolation, I tried few things but Im running out of options now.Listing below what I have tried so far along a quick comment and a grade (10 = highest efficiency)-working out - 8/10 - very good results during the first year, highly recommend ! Unfortunately I built a tolerance to the work-out wellness.-see a shrink - 1/10 - doesn’t help in my case. I don’t understand what to get out of it .-eating healthy - always did cant measure the effect-going to meetups - never enjoyed meeting randomish strangers not an option-drugs - reluctant to try and build addiction- opening up to my social circle : In our society there is no empathy for a straight adult male, no matter what you think, opening up will likely definitely socially kill me and get me labeled as an awkward weirdo. You just can’t show any form of vulnerability.So here are the recommendations that usually pop up in this kind of thread, please share yours.Thank youEdit :will add below interesting recommendations ill add on my todo list:-“Look up Wim Hoff. Do his guided breathing exercises on YouTube and then take a cold bath or shower every morning. Took me from suicidal to flourishing.”",,6/2/2022,41,720,11,Addiction,Others

Or, for some reason thought this was a good idea, decided to iron on a small board on the floor, knock it over and permanent burn the carpet with an iron imprint. Or she'll be in the tub, have a candle, knock the candle in the tub and get the wax all over the places.Worse Things: She got into a car accident where she wasn't looking and someone went into her on the side, denting the driver door (she was fine luckily), or drive aggressively on the road, scrape the bottom and need to replace the radiator. Or she lost her phone at the museum once (just bought her new iPhone) and (very luckily) found it in lost & found. Or today, she dropped her new iPhone in the tub (thank god its waterproof).Other things are annoying like she's doing Keto now and she's particular about what she wants to eat (in addition to no carbs - no fish, tired of chicken), so going out I get a $15 sandwich and we have to get her like $40 ceviche with drinks, etc that costs $80 for us.Anyways, I'm venting a bit now after having a beer because she doesn't work or has her own business which is losing money.

I try to keep busy like going to the gym and shopping, but it’s not working. It’s hard to make friends and to even put thoughts together or even have intimacy. I’m in my late 20s and feel like a loser almost all the time. I wanna find that special someone but I can’t even do that, no motivation or energy. I’m scared to socialize in social venues like bars, but I want to. I’m turning to Blind because I have nowhere else to turn to (family is not an option).

I see that I can anyways live a very happy life I want. No one can stop me from that. Yes, its not the life that I wanted once, still a life which a lot would dream of.

It’s extremely impact driven. As long as you can have “impact” , it doesn’t matter how you achieve it. Leadership is so blind to the feedback about team management, and manager can still get promotions as long as the team can keep delivering. Maybe it’s so broken along the whole report chain.All the manager cares is his own promotion. He only cares if it’s related to his own interest. That’s the only principle. I wonder if team feedback can be measured and included in the perf? Not only my husband suffers but no one dares to speak up :(You may ask, why not leave? I assume maybe the product is still growing?

And seems like I don’t remember what home feels like.I’m a single child to my parents, and had a good childhood. Lost sense of what great life I had, and moved away. And now I feel I’m emotionally unavailable/ disconnected with everyone. Lost interest in everything.Don’t feel like working or working out or doing something to ease my stress or depression.I keep remunerating about decisions I took in the past, and wonder all possible ways things would have turned out if I had not taken some decisions (many decisions bother me).Keep worrying about future, and how I would feel if something happens which I don’t want.Ever since I have moved to USA to do my masters it’s been a hard life. (I don’t have anything against USA, I love the country, wouldn’t have traded meeting great people for anything). I just feel alone, and have no one to tell my thoughts or ask for suggestions.Even after graduating from masters, I made myself who I am today —>I stayed without work for 3-4 months after masters. Then I got a startup job feeding myself hand to mouth (no savings). Found a new job at a company that went bankrupt and was on the verge of losing job, luckily got into a well known company.I worked my ass off with bad manager in the new company.

They are always in pleasing mode towards their leaders, which blinds them from taking right decisions for their team. Leads to bad WLB for their team.5. They are incapable of showing empathy. Look for behavior towards pregnant employees or new parents or someone taking emergency sick leaves.6. They fail to identify anything good in you and can only identify and highlight many flaws frequently. They never acknowledge your achievements or hard work.7. They are not mature hence retaliate when confronted with honest feedback instead of course correction.I have heard most of these traits from my friends working in other big tech companies.

I max out my 401k, hsa and save All my rsus(~40k) every year but still feel my savings are really small and i will get back in to poverty if i lose my job. Including 401k i save around 70k per year. I have cash of around 7 months of expenses including mortgage for emergencies. I lead a very modest life, drive a honda(new), visit india once a year etc. Been in US for 4 years now and have a net worth of 346k including properties i bought in india.This anxiety and obsession with savings has started impacting my personal life. Tbh i feel this worry will get me a heart attack lol. I spend around 3 hours everyday looking at my credit card statements, browsing finances forums and thinking of ways to save money. My spouse who doesn’t really have any luxurious needs or wants started calling out how miser i have become and seems to be very upset. I mean i think 10 times before i allow her to buy a $100 home decor item because i think we can live without it. I was never like this and it started since i got my gc in 2021.At the same time i see my colleagues who make less than me buy expensive gifts for their wives, drive expensive cars, take 2 international vacations per year and never stress about finances.How do i cope up with this anxiety? Am i thinking a lot about savings? How do these other folks manage all these luxuries with lesser salary than mine.Tc- 250k",,7/4/2022,31,1063,6,Indians Issue,Stress

Google,what then,Therapist trying to go private,"Hi folks,I’m in a situation that I’m not sure whether it’s normal or not. Looking for advice if you have seen therapist before.I recently went through a separation with my ex-gf after 3 years being together. It was not easy because it’s the first time I live with my significant other, and for 2 years in covid we’ve been interacting in the same home 24*7. So lots of memory and attachment towards each other.I went for Lyra mental health support after the breakup in hope for a good closure. The therapist has been helpful and I trusted him a lot. Initially all of our sessions have been remote because I was in LA and Seattle living with my best friends to distract myself.Recently, the therapist suggested we should meet in person. I agreed as it gives us more personal touch, and drove back from Seattle to Mountain View for a session.Towards the end of session the therapist raised two points that worries me:1. Lyra only allows in-person session now. So he can’t take me remotely if I continue to be staying with my friends elsewhere.2. To solve the problem, he can:- either convert me to private, which is 150$ per session. He says he does not take insurance and can provide receipt for health insurance reimbursement.- let me convert to another Lyra therapist who can do remote session.Is this normal? I have a feeling that this therapist is trying to profit off me, and I’m not sure if I should continue to trust him.Are there any other googler who has used Lyra mental health support before and can give me some advice?",,8/11/2022,22,606,4,Therapist Issue,Others

Every time my wife would get upset, I would promise her something to stay, whether it was marriage (while dating) green card (I’m American), money, or presents. Every time I did this was just buy myself sometime to fix the relationship, which I often would. Then it would hit the fan again, and I would promise something new.Now I’m hoping to realize it before it’s too late. I have set the entire dynamic completely wrong. Instead of focusing on improving myself, I relied on money and things to keep her happy, then become resentful when she would care about those things. It has been an endless loop to the bottom, I just hope I have caught it in time. I still have my job and money, but the current state of the Ponzi scheme is this: she has wanted so much that I’m at a tipping point, and the resentment has reached a level that am having trouble working on myself. Me getting a job at AWS just made me more resentful because there were more resources for her, and the stakes for higher.We had a fruitful conversation tonight that has lead me to this enlightenment.I know everyone will say I’m a psycho, divorce, therapy, etc. i ask that you please don’t judge me.I think I have fallen into depression and need to start with a therapist and some medication.

We don't resolve our issues, she's extremely vindictive when something goes wrong (""I want to hurt you"" is what she says to me).

For example, she was all happy and went to the tub and listened to some Instagramers about having kids and immediately has become depressed and angry at me because I don't consider my body for having kids-We don't resolve our problems-If I get something, she feels she needs to have something too (e.g. if I get a cookie then she needs to equally have something)-Intellectually very difficult to talk to her, she has a lot of brain fog so conversations are not exciting and rudimentaryI'm not sure what I get from our relationship, it feels like a lot of work and not much benefit.

It was a long ailment, we were glad that he was out of his misery. But that created a hole in our lives we didn't expect. Specially my mom... she loved her husband... until his last day she stood by his side as he went through weekly hell of dialysis. Nursed him back each time.

I felt bad for my dad, but felt bad for my mom too, who had given up her life to take care of the man she loved.When dad passed, I thought mom would feel free, but the opposite happened.. she felt lost.. she didn't know what to do with her time... we, her children, tried to make sure she wasn't alone.. but it didn't matter.. we had kids, thought it would distract her, but barely.. she keeps reminiscing about old days and the things they did.. I tried getting her back into one of her hobbies, but that didn't help either.Today, while all of us were gathered to celebrate buying our new home, she was so overwhelmed with joy that she collapsed. The thing is, we always lived in a rented apartment. My father tried very hard all his life, but couldn't fulfill his dreams so that we could fulfill ours.

My intellect gets clouded everytime I think of bad friendships I have had throughout. I have even tried to seek help from another friend by saying my thoughts/ overthrowing out loud but only to invite trouble and burn all the bridges. I am absolutely left with nobody to speak to because of which I am unable to focus on my work, unable to explore hobbies, unable to try anything new. Carry our the mundane routine of just going to office before important meeting, staying at desk, mostly ordering food on Grubhub/ doordash, listening to lots of loud music to forget this feeling of constant anxiety. Not wanting to do anything at anytime. My parents are really old and I don't know whom to seek help from as I don't have siblings. Besides that even the little relatives I have they are not from my field and they are constantly looking for a chance to get hold of my mistake so that they can ruin my parents reputation.

Amazon,livalonedy,"Last day at Amazon after 11 years, no one cares","This is mental health post... just want to vent out into the void... leaving after 11 years. No goodbyes from anyone let alone a party. I messaged my manager from 3 years ago who was a good friend I thought, he said he was busy for a chime call. Last month, we had a goodbye party for someone who joined last year where everyone met in person. Nothing remotely the same for me. A colleague reached out, I thought finally, until they asked me to drop something they'd loaned me at their desk. I helped promote half this team.I know I know, this is just me whining, but feel like I don't matter. Yes I am moving to better TC and company, but I spent 11 years at this company. Launched so many things, did so much, but did not accrue any friendships. Spent a third of my life here and no one cares. No one cares enough to even have a call, to say all the best or anything.Looking back, I feel like all my pushing back and disagreeing and committing for better of the product resulted in me looking like an asshole. Maybe that's just who I am. I feel miserable right now to think that I didn't matter to anyone. People tolerated me and not were happy to work with. Don't know what to do with all this. It hurts, it just does.Outside of our family, maybe more than our family we spend time with people we work with. And to think that my behavior made it transactional burns like hell.Edit: thanks a lot to those that gave support. You'll didn't have to, but you took the time and you did, so thanks! I am introspecting here, if I failed to make an impression on anyone in last 11 years then it's on me. Anyway, if you've read this far, let me just tell you, making friends out of strangers is a valuable thing, might seem quaint coming from someone with my TC I know, but having a friend you can just spend your day with and doing nothing is valuable too. If you have it, cherish it.",,9/4/2021,129,6126,114,Family Issue,Others

Credit Karma,zen123456,Kaiser mental health sucks!,"I have had mental health issues since I was a teen. Suffered from depression as a teen ( I think, never got a diagnosis). Had an abusive parent and a culture that invalidated me. Last year, I got a lot of anxiety due to covid and visa problems and a toxic team, to the point where I got insomnia and regular panic attacks. This year I'm doing much better, but I still have insomnia once a week, so I thought of reaching out to a therapist. I had always thought of doing that but either didn't have the money or was overwhelmed by life to have another item on my to do list.Well this year, I thought that because I'm in a better place emotionally and not overwhelmed to take care of myself, let me get therapy to deal with these issues. I contacted Kaiser mental health. They scheduled two sessions to screen me, and told me that as I am not depressed have ""just"" mild anxiety I don't need talk therapy. They told me that they would share online resources, and that there are groups that I could join ( those groups aren't group therapy, more like groups where people share tips on things that helped them, like mindfulness or trauma survivors). I pushed for talk therapy and I was told that basically because I could function and hold down my job , and wasn't psychotic/ severely depressed I didn't qualify for talk therapy.Wtf!Not only would I now have to pay out of pocket for therapy, I felt so invalidated during the screening that I would need therapy to recover from KaiserNow I'm stuck with Kaiser till the end of the year.PSA: If anyone wants to work on their mental health, don't take Kaiser.

Long distance, death in his family because of which he had substance addiction and I was not able to help him, I didn't know much about addiction and feel guilty that even though I tried my best I couldn't understand the symptoms and took his lack of love expression as he doesn't love me.

There is nothing taboo about it and hairloss is not something ""you just have to live with"".Lots of folks only take it seriously when their hairloss becomes really evident, and by then it's too late. You end up with expensive surgery being your only option, which may not even work.Update:If you just can't be bothered to physically go to a doctor, there are online-only services now that will let you 'virtually' get a consultation and prescriptions.Do it now and your mental health will thank you later.",,12/16/2021,104,3190,26,Others,Others

Lyft,lyftupp,(Rant) How long does it take to change jobs?,"My now husband has been trying to switch jobs for 3 years now.Some backstory, it started when we were still unmarried. I was about to graduate and he had been working for a few years with the same employer.We decided he will also start looking for jobs since it’s possible I might get an offer in different city.So I got an offer when I graduated and moved to a different city(combined decision) Plan was for him to keep looking and move as soon as he gets an offer. We did long distance for a while. Then Covid happened and we started working from home. Since work was remote, I moved in with him. After a while we moved back to where my job was and also got married. All this time he said he was studying but one thing or another kept coming so it wasn’t happening. I went with it and understood that. Meanwhile I started prep again and switched jobs and we moved to a different city in west coast (This city was the plan all along as my husband wanted to start up something of his own, this is another reason he says why job is not interesting to him and switch isn’t happening, however my argument is that if you can’t put in a few months effort to switch how are you gonna manage to start your own company ) now after my switch another year has passed and I have spent the first year of our marriage constantly just killing my desires and trying to support him in job prep. I want to to travel with him, go out, do things but everything I think of planning something it makes me feel guilty because his study will suffer. He has explicitly asked me to micromanage him and follow up on if he has scheduled any interviews. I have been constantly nagging him to schedule interviews for the last 3 months and he schedule 1 interview 2 weeks ago. Today I asked him if he has scheduled any more and he said it’s just off his mind and there were other things. This enraged me, There was a huge fight and I ended up hitting myself a lot after it. I’m feeling so miserable and helpless. I’m just so frustrated and have no one to talk to.When I ask him what the problem is, he either says there’s too much work, or he still needs to learn some topics, there’s always one thing or another.I don’t even want him to switch jobs now, I just want this endless loop of job prep to stop so we can live our lives. Our combined income is anyway enough to live a luxurious life. I used to be such a happy person and now I’m almost depressed. I feel lonely, sad and helpless.I earn 3 times my husband and I have never made him feel that he needs to earn more or equal to me. I just want him to realize his ambitions that he keeps talking about. I even suggested that we move to a LCOL city buy a home and just live peacefully but that won’t happen.I’m sorry guys but I needed to vent. It’s just not this, there’s lot more to the story and I just feel like I don’t want to exist anymore.He’s a great partner, helps with everything and is respectful but I’m just done being miserable.

Not doing well in my personal life/ relationships because I am just fucked up and just feel like I am trapped inside myself. All good things don't last long. People move away, relationships/situations change, people change. Life somehow manages to just yank out everything good in life. I just feel like quitting everything at this point.Yes, I am taking therapy, yes i took some days off. Although it has been difficult to express how I really feel to a therapist and I might have withheld a thing or two, he thinks 2 weeks break should be enough. I think I can take a lifetime of break right now and still not know if that will help. But I still can't ask for more, can I? Nope, because maybe I don't deserve this? (it's so hard to really come to a conclusion because of my mindset)One thing I am certain about, I don't deserve this life and I just feel really hurt :(#depression #burnout #mentalhealth",,8/24/2022,19,490,1,Therapist Issue,Burnout

Last 50 years we started eating lots of preprocessed food, refined sugars, bad oils, and this is fcking up our system, including mental health. Eat veggies, fruits, eggs, cheese, olive oil, probiotics, fish. Cut down on sweets, cold cuts, anything in that came out of a factory. Eat organic.2. Move - we are designed to move. We worked our bodies until about 50 years ago. Our mental health suffers if we dont get physically tired. Take a walk or a run, every day3. Get outdoors - never in history did we stay indoors for days. Get out. Preferably in nature4. Sleep - if you those things above mentioned, you will not have trouble sleeping. And take you electronics, phones, tvs out of your bedroom.5. Breathe - learn how to breathe correctly.6. Socialize - we are mammals, we need to socialize.Take it from an older guy.

Boeing,AeroEng56,Feeling Stuck & Depressed,"Hi all,Posting here to gain some feedback and hear what you all think.I've been at Boeing for a few years, and the company is starting to wear on me. I get stellar reviews, work really hard, and pour my soul into my engineering position. I'm constantly problem solving, picking up other's slack, and bringing new and inventive ideas to the table. Despite all this, I've been at an L2 for 3 years now.I have a Master's of Science in Aeronautical & Astronautical University from the #1 program in the world, and have consistently succeeded wherever I've gone.But now I'm stuck. My pay is peanuts (123k with OT), and I'm getting really frustrated hearing that I need to ""Put in the time"". I understand time means experience, but when I pick up stuff at 2-3x the pace, it's bothersome to not get recognized for that work.Now I'm at a point where I think I've become unhappy with engineering because my company is skewing my view of it, and I'm having difficulty getting responses on applications from the companies I'm applying to. I want to leave and go to a company that values me like I should be and sees my creativity as a positive skill that's valuable.All of this is leading me to feeling stuck and helpless, despite having a great career so far and education.Any recommendations?

BBT,pspskitteh,Feel absolutely hopeless. Where/how do I go from here?,"Sorry if this is long, any advice is appreciated.First it was the isolation when the pandemic started. Constant isolation for 2 years sent me to a very dark place mentally. An interaction(over video) I had with a group of friends during that time made me realize they were never my friends. That pushed me into deeper loneliness.When things opened, I found a visa appointment and visited home in India. Meeting family finally felt like things were looking up.Came back, team got a new manager. He was barely there for a month and told me that I'm not a good fit for someone working on his team. I'm not curious and hard working and unprofessional apparently. Constantly threatened to fire me and said some real nasty things like ""the security guy for the building can do what you're doing"" in front of other teammates. It reached a point where I was crying after work from all the pressure.Luckily found another position in a different team and the new manager seems cool.But I feel absolutely hopeless. I wasn't great at academics, didn't go to a great college, don't work at a prestigious company, no friends, no relationship and now I failed at work too. Working with that manager shattered what little confidence I had. Where can I go from here? How do I even start?

Amazon,whdvekwudb,Personal rant!,"Ok so this is personal and probably many cannot even relate but I need to let it out.I grew up with an emotionally immature mother who needed help pretty much at every stage of her life. Professionally she was successful and well established but personally she was a narcissist in the name of ‘single helpless mother’.At every stage of my life she involved others (extended family/ friends/ neighbors /anybody who would listen) to validate if I am growing up ‘correctly’. It was sometimes really embarrassing when she would bring up my personal habits like the time I spend in the bathroom, how I cook, how and where I spend my salary and age shaming and criticizing for my choices most of the times in front of others because I was far behind others who were my age (in her eyes). She always wanted a boy and never hesitated to tell me how disappointed everyone was when I was born.She also used to emotionally blackmail by telling how she would die one day, just to get things her way.I could never share any secrets with her or any personal or work related problems because they were broadcasted the very next day. And she would get all worked up and stressed and tensed and make it about herself instead of extending support and empathy. I remember I told her about my hair fall problem once and she said it makes her worried because I am not married yet.Now she is arranging matches for me by telling my extended family first and to me later. I find this matter extremely personal and believe it should be initiated by my mother, me and the guys family and then should be told outside. She argues that she cannot handle all of this by herself and needs help (even to make the first phone call to ask for just the basics). Now if I don’t like the guy for some reason the blame would be on me for being picky and everybody would know. My mother has openly blamed me for rejecting the guys in the past (only 2) and projected herself as the poor helpless mother who is trying very hard.The reason I don’t find someone on my own is because I am happy in my cocoon very far from home, living my private life without anyone’s interference and taking care of myself. I have extremely high standards and I know I might just end up alone so why bother.I was in therapy for 2 years because I have PTSD but then stopped it because it wasn’t helpful anymore.",,7/12/2022,18,638,10,Family Issue,Stress

I wish I had spent every second of his life with him.We went to the local vet, and we were told we need to euthanize him ASAP because he's struggling. I was fighting with my husband not to, he wanted to stop his struggle, so we booked a hospice appointment at home for later that evening so we have time to decide. Doggie looks at me, I was holding him tight but talking to my husband in the car, tried to tell me something - I still think he has hours to live so I didn't look at him while hugging him, he just passed on in my arms, in the car, on the way home. He loved long drives. I guess I didn't want to euthanize and he made the choice easier for me.I'm so broken. Crying inconsolably. Help!Sorry my sweet dog. I couldn't save you. I wish I didn't go to India, didn't have my surgery and had you at home instead.Every spot in my home and car reminds me of him.I adopted him when I was at the end of my last relationship, though a breakup, met my current partner, moved three homes, bought our final home. I wanted him to be there to move into our final home and see my reproductive child. But he couldn't. I hope he felt loved at the end. And knew that he was the world to me - more than everyone else except my parents maybe.😔",,2/5/2022,49,733,37,Indians Issue,Others

I am a good engineer (or my peers and managers say good to me) but I’ve been hiding behind work for almost a decade. I love to work and hate living. My family, Indian born, barely helps, mom and dad in an extremely emotional, rage, physically abusive relationship since I have had memories, likewise every relationship in a family of four of us. Traits have rolled over to my sister who has a kid and is divorced and now, I’m close with the kid and treat like my own but I’m worried for the kid. I help my parents and sister financially (unconditionally) and emotionally, hard to support morally except for words since I’m in the US. I have had bouts of depression, woke up crying, slept crying, since adulthood. I have literally a lot in my own hands, but even spending an idle moment, or resting a moment, I worry about my parents and sister and her kid and start a cycle of depression. I got a pet to stop my suicidal thoughts but am now waiting for my pet to get old and then think about suicide again. I am single and barely socialize outside of work, I don’t have any vices except for having good food. Thinking of trying weed.Working at amazon was perfect, busy work and messed up wlb kept me in line, but lately realized the comp gap and I want a better life so made steps to lc & gtfo.

Use every opportunity to impress the HM so you get that call back.They wanted me to help, so I talked them through what I know about the role, laid down tangible steps they can take, for how to prep for it based on the limited knowledge I have.

Google,mikepinpeo,"Grief, Trauma, and Perf","Long rant alert ⚠️Not long after I joined Google last year, my immediate families (including my mother) fell critically ill, and eventually died in extremely traumatic ways (cancer). At the time when this series of events happened, I was a new grad Noogler, and had not been able to build up my credibilities before being forcibly distracted from work.I don't regret putting aside work, and made my family my first priority by doing extensive research on their illness, handling logistics while in a different country, dealing with sophisticated quarantine protocols for travel, checking-in frequently with my other families, running between wards and ICUs, getting opinions from different doctors. But man, I wish I had communicated better with my team. The worst thing that happened to me was seeing my close families dying, and thinking that my first perf, and subsequently my career (you might laugh at my ability to pull anxiety out of thin air), was struggling too.In the end, my families died, and I took a very short bereavement leave given how behind I felt at work, and I feel it's all my fault. Like it's my fault that I couldn't ""balance"" seeing the death of my family one after one, and excelling at work. I'm grateful for my manager though. I was panicking that I'd get an NI, but I was reassured that a CME would be underway.I realise how uncomfortable we are about loss, to the extent that even avoid acknowledging them. When I look at the Emails in my inbox every day, it's all kudos, launch celebrations, etc. When I talk to people, they talk about ""impact"", ""promo"", etc. Sometimes that made me mad, and I felt like the loneliest man alive.I guess the feelings intensified because perf is coming. I find it unfair that while under the same expectation, I have to deal with tremendous grief and trauma everyday. When I closed my eyes, their struggles and our memories intertwined in front of my eyes, and I know that we will never cross path in this life again.I've been receiving counselling, and I'm figuring out my way to escape from this mental mess. Please don't try to figure out my identity, this is meant to be anonymous. I love you all.TC: 194k",194000,2/14/2022,18,2076,58,Family Issue,Anxiety

Microsoft,🥚🥚🥚hi,How do I regain the lost spark in myself?,"I’m currently fourth year into my second job, and I’m feeling extremely lost about life and my career. In the last few years, I’ve taken many different routes to get to product management - I started off as a consultant, and then applied to Microsoft as a PM and landed a PM role eventually.I started casually applying to PM roles this March, and I spent ~2-3 months studying for more than 10+ hours each week to prepare for product manager interviews. Sadly, I’ve gotten rejected by all the companies I’ve applied for.I feel like something was missing during my prep (I’m not exactly sure what it was, but I was definitely my own enemy in the process) and these rejections made me doubt my ability on whether I’m suitable for the PM role or not.I’m a very disciplined hard worker. So I’m performing well at work (but in the last few weeks I haven’t been working as much, because I’ve been feeling so tired and sad). I don’t feel like my current roles gives me a real PM experience at Microsoft, that’s why I have a strong urge to apply roles elsewhere to pursue for skills that I want to build.My mental health from 2020-2022 has been extremely bad, and I’m currently on meds to help stabilize my mood.I admitted to my psychiatrist that I’m extremely good at “covering” my flaws, so none of my family members and friends know I’m struggling with life. I’ve only told my boyfriend about this, and he’s been a great support of mine.I want to recalibrate all the lessons I’ve learned in the last 3 months, and start applying again.Has anyone experienced a similar situation?

They just push me every day to accomplish things that are out of my control.During my 1:1s my boss always gets situational and always expects me to be smart and strategic in dealing with cross-functional teams but practically it is not possible.On top of that, I am having a huge learning curve in all my projects. As a Senior Engineer - my boss expects me to ace every task which is assigned to me. Every day morning I make my mind stronger and more positive but by noon I lose hope, become depressed and lose confidence. I always ask for extra time to complete my projects.

She is very pretty and has a beautiful voice. She was originally a new anchor by profession before venturing into tv serials.We have had on/off stalking incidents on social media where she would write message to me but we wouldn’t talk on phone.Off late I have noticed that when I am trying to make out I get hesitant or even get anxiety because I would think about her.

Juniper,holy_moly_,Afraid of where life is going,"Last few years have been difficult. I feel like I have just lost connection with myself. I was always an introvert / shy / timid but I think I am just becoming worse with every passing year. Life has managed to somehow take out all the positive energies/ people from my life and just keeps on adding things that I really struggle with. I am terrified of just growing up and feeling even worse with every other chapter of life and struggling to accept .I don't think I am a bad person,yes I want to be selfish but I feel like I end up convincing myself to do the exact opposite every single time.I want to just be alone for a while, quit everything and maybe magically i start feeling better again. What's more likely is that I will become even worse.Therapy and medicines also don't seem to be helping and I have realized that therapy itself is a difficult/challenging process.Although I tell my therapist that I never think about harming myself everytime he asks me because I can't do that to the people around me, I don't want to ask him what he thinks about my amazing plan to just ignore some of the things that I should be checking boxes for in my response to ""Do you have any disabilities"" question. People think I am joking or tell me i am being unrealistic when I tell them i want to do things that they tell me only people after retirement do. I wish I can prove them wrong someday if I manage to get out of this phase and one day also get back in the field because I enjoy it, just not like this .Sorry folks.

Badly burnt bridges.This year I had 2 opportunities : one from Confluent and one from one of the gig companies ( Uber/ Doordash/ Lyft) to be a part of their marketing team. I said no to Confluent and accepted the gig company offer because: this role had a larger team and my manager also had a large team. So I thought this could be a better opportunity ( now thinking back I know this was a stupid question evaluation criteria)Now I regret this decision very badly. Gig companies do not excite me and I am worried that this will take me away from B2b saas marketing. I am worried if do this job then the B2b tech companies will not hire me as I am not from the industry(in marketing this is very common. They want to hire people from the industry. Tech companies usually hire form other tech companies)I am in between jobs ( joining in Nov in the gig company) and I am a mess. I am not even sure if I want to join and I am worried if I join it will mess up my future prospects in B2b. I am loosing it.I feel like I always miss the opportunities and this one I regret terribly.

Juniper,holy_moly_,Don't have what it takes,"I don't have the people skills to be in the industry. Over the years I have become even more quiet, non confrontational, have lost friends because of distance, have been alone for a few years, relied on some extended family and felt like i was not treated like a family member before I could earn, have seen complicated relationships in my family.Some call me a yes man but its just that even if I am not a people person, I always try to be there for the people around me, I want to be selfish but something somehow just manages to convince me to do the exact opposite (most times). It's hard for me to move on if I hurt someone or someone else hurts me.At work, I find it difficult to work with people who I can't connect with, where you don't feel like it is a safe place where you can be vulnerable and then learn and grow together, or a few who I think are really smart people who just know their shit, who I feel can lead, teach you how to fish without doing it themselves, people who will help you grow in your career.People who don't make the effort to make you feel comfortable, people who don't have the skills to back up their confidence, the way they talk to you feels more authoritative and less collaborative, people who introduce so much structure into the team env that everything feels like a chore.I have gone out of my way to help people with their work, have never worried about recognition but have focused on team wins.I don't have what it takes to grow though. I find it difficult to handle situations where you have to delegate, where you might have to take some decisions which might affect people who you care about.We often talk about hiring people with complementing skill sets. But I think there is also scope for consideration for people's social skills and mental state/ mindset/ life values. Pay me less if you want but I think I need an environment where I can make this decision. not everyone can be leader, wants to be one, not everyone wants values the same things, and some might want to stay in a certain stage which they feel they fit in and can still be able to contribute. Yes, you also need to be challenged for you to grow but no one method, direction, timeline will work for everyone.I am considering leaving this race entirely and leaving this life behind but right now that too seems impossible.#depression #mentalhealth",,8/17/2022,12,421,5,Family Issue,Mental Health

Fear of unknown, economy collapse, getting uncomfortable, fear of confrontation etcI was never good at physical activities so naturally deviated away from it.

Don't know much about cars, how to fix basic stuff etc. I think when I become stronger physically, I will be more confident on how to handle these things.But its difficult for me to feel confident, secure and stand up for myself.

Every single thing that ever comes up in ""don't be racist"" training is something my parents taught me from birth to do.I even have the white victim complex, even though minorities have never done anything to me. In my job for example, I also previously couldn't help but feel like I'm treated as a lesser priority since I'm a white male, and I definitely didn't feel like I was allowed to talk about it. I don't have any white coworkers. e.g. Asian and hispanic coworkers are really common, and sometimes speak in foreign languages, which makes it hard to socialize at times without feeling like I'm majorly butting in. Most are older than me which increases barriers further. And that's just at the socialization level. At the HR level I felt similar to how Asians do due to not being diverse. It felt like that on both the social and legal level I was a cog in a machine that they're waiting to replace with either an Asian they can get along with and hire cheaply or a diversity hire. I know upon retrospection when I rethink things like the above that everything in this paragraph is bs, but I can literally feel the stupid bs in my veins from everything my stupid parents taught me. It's harder for me to ditch than even religion was.Have any other white people grown up from similar backgrounds? Is there like a book I could read on how to not be like this? It feels like I have to relearn my entire behavior from scratch whenever I realize I'm mimicking something from someone's behavior I knew when I grew up. I literally need ""how to not be a terrible person"" training.",,2/25/2022,51,784,13,Family Issue,Others
Amazon,🧀✏️🍿,Join the other side or keep grinding?,"TL;DR: To turn my passion project into my day job, I would have to report to a person who used to bully me (other’s labels).Should I do this or keep toiling away off the side of my desk?Exceed your weekend reading quota with thiscontext (code words for anonymity). It’s split into an origin story and a recent upheaval status.Origin story:When I had an idea for a marvel franchise. I talked to Warner Brothers about their DC franchise. I told WB that I envision the marvel franchise streaming movies, releasing books, selling action figures, branding with clothes, etc. at that point, WB was only releasing comics, had syndicated shows, and old movies that they’d refresh every 5 years.To start this franchise, I suggested marvel grow under WB, being filmed on WB lots and sharing production artists, actors, etc. Instead, they connected me to other indie production companies, who never had any money to fund my franchise, but shared a lot of guidance. They continued releasing a movie every 5 years with lots of interest.A year later, I started releasing the iron man movies. Warner Bros. called me monthly, saying I was why they needed Tylenol. Their actors and production artists wondered why these comic book movies weren’t released by them and why everybody and their mother knows about these iron man movies.While they’ve owned the Batman franchise forever and always sell out their small theater releases, my viewer numbers are much larger. I’ve partnered with streaming companies who don’t have ticket and theatre size limits.Over the last year, things calmed down as I grow my volunteers and reduce contact with WB. As our volunteers grow, we are slowly releasing other marvel movies to meet people’s interests and requests. We still haven’t gotten formal funding and can’t expand the franchise to toys and clothing. The monthly Tylenol complaints stopped. Perhaps because Marvel and DC are still in a lot of the same circles, but don’t engage much. I have tried to be civil, usually refer folks to WB’s DC for next-level produced materials.Recent upheaval:However, the last few weeks got stressful again regarding a random Comic-Con I set up (despite WB seeing no need to create a Comic-Con for folks to nerd out and trade advice). It’s ran for two years on its own with minimal maintenance from me. WB used to list it as a community resource on their website, but late last year advertised it all over their website. They set up a help booth at the conference too.A few weeks ago, I updated a help app that we originally released over a year ago for the Comic-Con. I tweaked some beta tools and posted a reminder that anybody can use the tools and all.WB repeatedly told me they don’t understand the point of this app, that it’s putting too much strain on their RAM in their androids, and they want me to shut down the app.IMHO, they don’t need to use the app because they know more than it, but others can use the app if they want or they can go to WB’s help desk. Why not let it live for those who want to use the app?They want it shut down until android manufacturers start using a next gen chip that addresses all of their issues with the app. The app was designed because of android current chip’s requirements. I have no idea if android even knows a chip is needed.They’re seeking more producers to fund their next series of DC movies and based on fan demands, they’re going to get into toys and clothing. I asked if we could revisit how DC and marvel could explore a collaboration again. Perhaps share actors and production artists. I just don’t know how we differ or complement each other, and I wanted to explore this with them since we haven’t talked for a year. Or perhaps get officially owned by WB so it’s my day job.My concerns:I feel they are only opening the convos of buying for a few reasons.1. Our brand is more well known and our customer numbers would double theirs2. They want to use our streaming partnerships3. They want to micromanage me and shut down my app for Comic-ConTo add to the temptation of selling out, I just moved to a new manager. We’re designing space colonies (still using code words 😅). My manager lets me spend 20% of my time on marvel because they recognize how many benefit from the culture and arts of super heroes. My manager is always transparent to me and has taken a huge gamble on somebody who has no knowledge about space colonies, but I’ve renovated college and business campuses. They let me learn at my own pace. Their team is talented and egoless. Plus, I imagined that one day, I would captain a ship and build a space colony that would be kind, eco friendly, and have an art and science renaissance.Although, I am tired. I’ve produced these movies for 2+ years. All the Indies keep telling me no. A few other entertainment conglomerates turned me down because they only want to focus in their country and don’t want to go global. I’m already global.Edit: Should I let WB buy Marvel and work for somebody who will shut down some of my stuff, continue only creating more marvel movies while designing space colonies, or let them buy Marvel with my lieutenants continuing to drive marvel creation while I offer board member or consultant oversight and I continue designing space colonies?TC: 170kYOE: ~5 + unrelated career 9#burnout #mentalhealth #depression #careeradvice",170000,7/30/2022,14,750,4,Indians Issue,Stress

Delphix,mehohwell,"Accommodations for ADHD, anxiety, depression at remote startup","Hello Blind community, I really need your help. For the past several months, my manager has been bugging me about non-urgent issues and it’s affecting my ability to focus on what’s truly important and generates a lot of revenue. We don’t see eye to eye on what’s urgent so that’s a dead topic now.I’ve explained to him that I have ADHD and anxiety and that I need to be able to focus and that his last minute “urgent” slacks and requests for random reports are really affecting my work (and the number of hours I end up needing to work so I can get it all done between all these artificial distractions). I come from several successful companies (one fortune 100, two startups that IPO-ed during my tenure, one acquired by Salesforce), where sales leaders let you do your job however best works for you, as long as you’re hitting your numbers, and aren’t causing legal issues for the company.Fast forward to this week, it only got worse. We had a conversation with HR, and I tried not to bring up my disability at first, but as the manager dropped some words such as “no you don’t get to use your critical thinking skills” and “it’s not up to you to prioritize what’s important”, I had to put my foot down and name drop Anxiety and ADHD for them to start paying attention.I’m on a small sales team, I overachieve on my quota on a regular basis, they keep taking accounts away while raising my quota, and telling me that it’s concerning that I’m working 12 hour days every day and that it “shouldn’t take this long” because “they did it too” before. When I overachieved my already very high quota by 325% couple months ago, they refused paying me the full commission amount and told me I needed to go to Salesforce and justify every single deal in order to get paid. I just decided to take a hit and meet them in the middle in the interest of keeping my otherwise very sweet job.None of my teammates hit their quota last month while I did 120%, and I’m already at 46% this month as of August 5. The product is amazing, and I do enjoy working with my accounts. I asked my manager “why are you bugging me, I’m out performing everyone while on the highest quota on the team”, and he doesn’t agree that it’s enough. He slacks me about small leads that could wait while I’m on an important call with a colleague or a customer, and told me I have one business hour to respond to a new lead and that’s “nonnegotiable”. He even said that I should’ve hung up on my colleague, and told him that I needed to get back to my leads. After he said that, I understood that there was no reasoning with him.In the interest of keeping my job in this yet another uncertain time of layoffs and never-ending Covid and now the market decline, I am NOT considering moving to another company just yet as my tenure with this one is not long enough. Additionally, I have really gotten good at selling this very technical product in my specific patch and made important connections with customers. It’s a very lucrative gig that I don’t want to leave just because my manager is an asshole.HR sent me an email summarizing everything after this call, and asked me to list what accommodations could help me moving forward. The company is fully remote, and it has nothing to do with a loud office space or getting allowance for headphones or medical reimbursement.Literally, all I need them to do is let me do my job the way I do it, and not constantly ping me about things that are really NOT that urgent.How do I officially phrase it to them so that my manager actually leaves me be, stops checking my emails and leads and lets me use my judgement (that has not ever resulted in non-performance). The ideal end result is positive for all of us versus them finding some random reason to fire me in a month. I understand that now that my medical condition is on file with HR, it is not going to be easy for them to let me go. But I’m sure companies find creative ways to do it so that they can say the reason was not related to my disability.Again, I am not trying to leave this company or manager, only asking for advice on how to correctly ask for these “accommodations” so I can stay and continue outperforming my peers and making very good money :)Thank you all in advance!TC: 320K OTE + about $50-70K in stock options#depression #mentalhealth #anxiety #hrissues",320000,8/7/2022,13,433,5,Toxic Manager,Anxiety

Berkeley Lab,quhea33,"Scientist willing to do crisis support, ""coaching"", etc.","So these days I'm quite a successful research scientist. To be where I am now I definitely sacrificed human interactions a lot. After reaching a few years ago what felt like an absolute lowest point in my personal life — when all the shit has finally accumulated and collapsed — I finally started implementing some changes. I started intentionally doing things outside of my comfort zone, trying to be radically honest with myself, taking responsibility for choices, and eventually going to therapy. I wouldn't be able to do all of this without the help of my friends, who encouraged me to finally face my problems. Among various outcomes I should mention that I was able to turn my research from a religion to an actual daily job which I still do like, but which I'm no longer obsessed with, as I don't really see it as something giving the ultimate value to me. I think for tech guys the analog of this would be caring less about ""career"" in general.Wondering what my colleagues would think if I told them that in the last year I read more books on psychology than research papers on my topic… The most enjoyable things in my life — those which actually feel like giving it some meaning — are volunteering on a crisis support phone line, helping out my numerous depressed friends, etc. Upon familiarizing myself with the ""mental health industry"" in the US, I'm overall quite disappointed about it. In most cases, the ""treatment"" is largely symptom-based, and nobody encourages patients to focus on actual reasons for their suffering — trauma, existential issues, etc. Instead people are trying to be ""functional"" and socially acceptable… and then they are surprised that their existence based on these criteria is miserable! And all of this in the country, which gave the world such people as Irvin Yalom and Nancy McWilliams…Things are even worse when it comes to ""coaching"", which often works like ""let me help you achieve your short-term goals (inspired by social expectations!) without taking any responsibility for you feeling even worse in the long run upon achieving them"" — especially if used not for career goals but rather those in personal life. I also had a chance to meet some local self-proclaimed new-age gurus, which spit out a mixture of popular psychology / superficial rituals / Eastern or American shamanism / … with some phenomenal confidence and zero soul behind it. Damn, I swear that psychedelic trips which I conducted for my friends were more useful and, for sure, way less harmful (at least, they were motivated by some kind intentions and not by an attempt to sell some addictive product). Well, apparently prescribing a pill and a self-soothing activity works better in this market.Anyways, I'm sure that there are enough people in the Bay Area whom I could offer some real things. Call me a perv but I am happy to be with those in pain and support them. I like to accompany people diving into their void and stepping out of their comfort zone. I like to talk deep and to give my perspective on people's lives, to teach self-awareness and basics of psychology (which by no means replaces finding a decent therapist!), etc. I would like to connect with tech and creative guys across the Bay and offer them my ""services"", which I would personally describe as smth like ""targeted intentional friendship"", but have no clue where to begin.

Amazon,burnburn,Starting to burn out or just need a break,"I've always considered myself kinda untouchable - left home country after high school, struggled to fit in at first, having not so great financial situation, landed good job after software engineering studies at Amazon. My first manager was a micro manager for almost a year, i think he didn't think much of me. Then i had a better manager, but i worked my ass off a lot, got promoted pretty quickly. Then there were re orgs and because I always want more i decided to go from software engineer to manager when the timing seemed right. A manager at the time warned me, i was replacing someone who left because of burnout. It was tough but made it through. Then re org again and now I'm in a different setting. It was fine for a while but maybe 2 weeks ago I started just to be overly emotional and I'm having a harder than usual time controlling it. The trigger was the fact that my manager was telling me that I'll be over hired next year and that i would need to transfer people out, something i do not want to do. He also wanted me to transfer a project to some other team which was overhired in our org, we were half way through, so i did manage to convince him it was a bad idea, bad idea for my team morale... I don't know why this was a trigger, i think it was even hypothetical.. at the same time i have another project running late, where I am dependent on an external team. product managers are harassing me for updates every day, for something that is not really even that big of a gain for customers. And then on the personal front, my boyfriend and I started to look for an apartment to buy in a different city - we've talked about moving eventually for years, but now it's becoming real, and this is stressing me out as well. If we go with buying an apartment, we will have to make a loan which will make me even more stuck to a job.

Dell,deltaman33,FMLA (for caregiving leave) and then short term disability (for mental stress),"Background: Wife’s friend has been with tech company in Midwest for 15 months and super stressed between work and caring for mom with dementia. She’s on FMLA now (paid parental care leave from work also kicks in for six weeks) and the 12 month period ends next month 11/15.Situation: Due to caregiving her mom and spending time in the nursing home and witnessing other patients and her mom’s poor health, she’s developed a debilitating anxiety and depression. Unable to sleep, heart palpitations and overall burned out. The doctors are suggesting she go on psych meds ( Zoloft) and also asking her to take some time off to relax and recuperate.Decision: she has decided to continue with her work leave beyond FMLA. Doctor and friends have advised she extend longer to a job unprotected leave into ADA/short term disability (std) insurance right after her FMLA ends, so that way it will be a smooth transition and she doesn’t have to go back to work and encounter any more stressors. Her STD is running concurrently with her Fmla so she will have 26-12 = 14 weeks of 100 % paid std remaining she can take.Question: can her employer fire her for taking the short term disability right after Fmla ? And even if they fire her will she be able to continue getting the short term disability? What other issues does she need to be mindful of. More importantly, should she go back to work after her Fmla and risk being fired or pip’ed or should she just continue with her leave? And If they fire her while she’s on disability, can she sue the company for retaliation.Thanks for your advise and comments. No trolling please, we are going through a lot already.",,10/21/2022,7,327,1,Family Issue,Stress

I don't see her holding a job either in the future (actually she has her own business which loses money).To be honest, I'm not super excited about buying a place right now. Also, we're having relationship problems so clearly this doesn't make sense. I've communicated it to her and just turns into terrible fights. Pretty much, if I'm not onboard with her or at least teasing the idea with her it turns into terrible fights and the days are miserable.I work at home and multiple times a day she'll talk about houses and which ones are cute, which I play along on.

Amazon,ghery,Can someone who can relate to this and tell me how to live life without anger and frustration?,"Single. Female 29. I live alone in a small 350 sq ft studio apartment. I always have frustration, extreme anger and not happy with anyone and anything because I am tired of struggling too much to get even basic things.About me - I am not smart but very hardworking. I usually get things only when I put lots of effort. Struggling with day to day work.Family - Have good relationship with family. Parents are uneducated and older sister is not married. So I am tired of searching a boy for her and taking family responsibilities when my friends enjoy their life. They keep talking about their problems when I call them.Friends - None. I am an extreme introvert and have social anxiety. Used to live with roommates. Had to leave them as they were too noisy. Had 3 close friends.I was interested 1 friend in him but he kept asking me money and I lost interest due to his insecurities. 2 other friends just call me when they need me for something. No emotional communication happens with themLove life - None. Just sleep on weekends as I am tired. Had loved someone 7 years ago and it didn't work out. Never had a sex life. I don't enjoy movies, p**n, Netflix anymore.These are not huge problems. I am grateful that I am in US, have a job but worried too much about future, insecurities. When I see my friends, they are all younger and happier without any worries. Had my birthday but nobody wished. Its the same for every birthday. People in my life only suck something out of me.I am that person who broke poverty in my family. Always followed the work is worship rule and thought relationships with people are waste of time as they anyways change. I am very stingy and carefully spend money as I want to save for my future. I don't show my anger in office but at home, I am constantly frustrated.When I meet people, they ask about hobby, what I like, I don't know what to answer all I know is work. Because of all these, I have zero tolerance for even slight inconvenience. I just burst out of anger once in a while. I scream and my entire body pains. I need atleast a day, to get back to normal when I am angry. But, most of the time, I look calm on the outside but in my home, I am constantly angry about the latest inconvenience and curse the person who caused it(looking at their profiles, envying them). Its a huge drain in my energy. Can someone who can relate to this can provide better coping mechanism?TC - 200K#mentalhealth #burnout",,3/25/2022,40,1068,11,Family Issue,Burnout

I recently received an offer from a company for FTE for SE 3 ( in testing) and the offer is a decent one compared to my last.I always desperately wanted to change my work stream from testing to either development or Data side, i did couple of AWS certifications , built an app or two in Android, learnt SQL, python but was never able to make a switch since I had no experience.I am now in my mid thirties and is worried and depressed when I look at my career , I am still an SE3 working as a tester and is far away from either being in a managerial role or switching streams (bcos if I switch i have to start from beginning).I often feel like i have wasted a lot of my time and is now nowhere in my career and its going nowhere but down. This feeling of helplessness and depression is taking a toll on me and I feel that I haven’t achieved anything in my life.Thanks for reading it.#seekingadvise#sdet#career",,6/16/2022,27,636,,Toxic Manager,Depressed

I have two degrees, one in comms and a masters in library science. I work at a DEI company and my non-direct, thinks she’s my manager, manager (because she’s on “leadership” she thinks she’s MY boss) constantly sends me passive aggressive messages all day and pretty much just demeans every move I make.Meanwhile, I’m in charge of all our internal contracts (writing proposals, replies to RFPs, MSA/SOWs), I manage all our marketing content plus one intern, I handle operations, such as creating new processes, negotiating with vendors, dealing with finance to invoice our clients, and have to solve little operational problems that crop up amongst my team members (like when tech breaks or someone can’t access a program). Oh, I also schedule ALL of our CEO’s meetings and ALL of the scheduling and onboarding for client engagements too. My “manager” only manages ClickUp and literally works part time, 3 days a week.And I make $51,000. I started at $50k, but got a 1k raise this New Years. I’m #burnout. I’m depressed. I had a miscarriage a month ago and could only take 2 days off work, and even then our CEO was still texting me about work stuff.

After 2.5 years of dealing with this, I switched to another company, this time the boss was great, but the work itself was dead end with no growth opportunities, and after most of the team started quitting due to lack of faith in management, I decided to switch again.Now, I'm working with a manager who is low key narcissistic. I say low key because unlike a typical narcissist, this person doesn't yell or berate outright, infact they're constantly charming and upbeat, but there's a lot of 1) favoritism 2) boasting 3) gossiping about other team members behind their backs 4)lack of boundaries and glorifying overworking /not taking time off5) pitting people against each other stating ""healthy competition"" 6)expecting people to take calls past 6-7PM etc and so much more. Strangely its not just my boss, but the entire team seems to revel in this culture.Needless to say, I'm miserable and burnt out, so I plan to quit soon, but I'm worried that anywhere i go, I will have to deal with a similar toxic workplace and narcissistic managers since so much of what makes one successful in the tech world are these very qualities.Are there any good tech companies out there that have checks in place to dissuade toxic narcissistic leadership traits?I'm almost wondering if I should look for alternate careers but I do enjoy my work as a product manager, just tired of dealing with psycho bosses. that make me question my self worth.TC: $230K",,7/2/2022,12,569,10,Toxic Manager,Stress

I would think seeing me work so hard, exhaust myself to meet our expenses would be enough motivation for them, but it’s not.They tell me to keep going and apply for more jobs and internally I’m screaming “What about you?”It’s not that they’re not contributing to our expenses AT ALL, it’s just not enough, and I know they’re not meeting their full potential, either out of fear, or lack of motivation, or depression.Anyway, that’s the rant.

Optum,J1p8901,How to heal from past trauma?,"5 years ago I went through a very tough time in my life and those days still haunt me.Witnessed first death in the family, my grandfather passed away 5 years ago and I had nightmares for months regarding the same. I grieved all alone in a room with nobody checking on me. My parents live in India and I always put up a smiley face on video calls so as to not put them under stress.While I was healing from the above trauma, I met with an accident and couldn’t walk for a month. I was living alone with a roommate who was not very helpful. For every little chore I had to walk slowly with a broken leg and go for groceries, do laundry, cook food etc.To add to the miseries, I had couple of cousins living in the same area as me with whom I have spent years of summer vacations, but not one person called to check on me or offered help or asked about my well-being, I always saw them having a gala time on Insta. Didn’t have any close friends as I had moved to a new city.My landlord was very miser and didn’t turn on the heater in cold days of February and would always complain about anything I did. Wanted to move out of the house but I had deep injury.I have seen few years of loneliness in life and that changed me drastically. I am not able to bond with people as it always feels like nobody gives a F**k. I used to be a very bubbly person, talkative, always smiling and laughing, but that has changed today. I have become so fragile that watching a shitty movie with some emotional scenes also make me cry and people wonder why!Today I am married and have a very caring husband. But I can’t let go of my past. My husband is the only one I consider mine and am not able to connect to anybody else, not even my parents. I feel so much distance from everybody.If somebody has gone through some unforgettable trauma how did you get over it? I know lot of people will recommend a therapist but I feel it’s hard to communicate what I feel as it’s years and years of misery (this is just a short glimpse of events that haunt me)#burnout #mentalhealth",,2/14/2022,50,768,10,Indians Issue,Stress

There are lots of things that I think could be the cause. For example, breakup with long term partner, burn out, not having family nearby, losing more and more close friends as they seem to be becoming more wealthy and having extravagant lifestyles (that I don’t want to be a part of), not having the slightest clue about what my purpose is, and finally not being too hopeful about my future since homeownership seems unattainable/high risk despite the high income I supposedly have (Canada).If I try to solve one thing, it could result in another problem I have becoming worse.

Good friends are always hard to make in your life and it only gets harder as you grow older.5. Don’t think you’ll always have the iron body, don’t take it for granted, take care of fitness don’t give it up. You won’t always be able to sleep so easy, or have high metabolism, watch what you put in your body.6.

In some meditation sessions, I inadvertently fall asleep. A nice little nap and I wake up very refreshed. That is helpful. The only downside to napping, that I've found, is that it throws off my sleep schedule as I then stay up a little later and thus can't wake up as early, so I haven't incorporated it into my routine.The other habit, which has been the most impactful, is cardio workouts, and surprisingly, the more the better. I used to run 5k ~3-4 times per week, so, 10-15 miles per week. When I significantly increased my miles, running 5-7 times per week and more 10k's than 5k's, I felt way better. Didn't matter the speed, in fact the slower the better, because if I went slow, then I could run more miles per week. The feeling after a slow 10k was actually better than a fast 5k. If there is any soreness, I just take a break and a day or so later I'm fine. I expect a few more breaks when I'm older, but that doesn't seem like a big deal.I'm sure everyone's body is different in what they can handle, but this was my experience.",,5/24/2022,22,575,7,Therapist Issue,Others

Netflix,krankman,Dealing with PTSD from toxic work environment,"Long story short…had a manager in my prior role who would constantly berate, gaslight me, and any work deliverable I created he would just tear apart. Constantly threw me under the bus too in front of senior management. Found myself dreading work every single day, ridden with anxiety, walking on egg shells 24/7. Eventually got to the point where I couldn’t deal with him anymore, knew PIP was coming my way, and landed offer somewhere else before I could get axed.Fast forward 8 months later and I am realizing that experience has really put a dent in my self confidence . I find myself doubting my abilities, struggling with crippling imposter syndrome, even paranoia that my new coworkers will suddenly turn against me and make life a living hell even though they have expressed that I’ve been doing great in the role this far. Even have frequent nightmares up until this day that I still work at my prior company and that my former manager is ripping me a new one over this or that task.I would love to hear from others who have also been through something similar and how you eventually got over it.

So I said I know where the issue is and i started explaining it him but he just wont listen. Then he shows me c# code that does the same and kept telling me how easy it is. So I said it works bit differently in Javascript and started walking him thru my code and he just lost it. He said I insulted him by saying he doesnt know shit about javascript and he got to this position because he knows everything and I should not telling him this simple stuff. I said can you just hear me out first and he wouldnt stop that he is my senior and I am his junior blah blah. So I apologized for insulting him and he also called me emotional.

I also did not feel valued about the work I did sometimes. I feel like I am struggling to meet the team’s and the managers’ expectations.I started to gain weight due to eating a lot of deliveries and junk food, and found it more difficult to sleep. My migraine also started and sometimes the pain killer is not working any more. I feel like crying often.This is hurting my work performance. It took me much more efforts and time than previous to concentrate and finish a task, which means I need to work overtime more. However, working overtime more deprived my sleep more and my anxiety got worse. This is like a vicious cycle.What should I do? Could I take a sick leave?I am already anxious about calling in sick so I am worried that I would get fired after coming back. I could not use FMLA.

Amazon,wawY45,How to find a therapist for FMLA at Amazon when you get a Pivot Entry.,"The process has been very confusing, so here's what I wish I knew upfront:0. Noone knows which conditions qualify and which don't qualify for FMLA.It's said that ""burnout"" alone may not qualify as serious enough.It's said that ""adjustment disorder w/ anxiety + depressed mood"" may qualify. As well as any other ""anxiety"" and/or ""depression"" diagnosis.Amazon DLS doesn't reveal a full list of issues that do or don't qualify.1. Look into the benefits guide on the benefits website, there's a whole section for mental health. Call ResourcesForLiving EAP; ask them to provide you with a list of [in-person non-Talkspace] therapists that, (1), accept RFL EAP, (2), accept your insurance (unless you have Kaiser or HMO, then you may be out of luck). There's no self-serve to get such list yourself as of 2021 [don't bother registering on RFL website, it's useless, they'll tell you as much when you call]; you have to call and they have to email you. They should email you a list right away. RFL's IT is incompetent, so it'll be in your spam folder, or outright rejected by the mail server. Don't give up.2. Call each number on the list. Expect to make a total of 10 to 20 calls to find a therapist. If you get a switchboard or a receptionist, politely hang up, those are useless. If you get a personal voicemail, leave a message for the therapist to call you back. If you get a therapist, ask them if they're accepting new clients, confirm that in-person/video/phone works as per your preference (usually all ""in-person"" sessions are done over video in 2021), whether they accept EAP and your healthcare insurance, whether they would be willing to evaluate you to see if the life- and/or work-related stress / anxiety / depression you're having may qualify you for FMLA. Tell therapist you may be interested in biweekly sessions for 12 weeks (6 or 7 sessions total) to deal with the issues. Setup an appointment. You'll need at least one official session before they can determine if you suffer from anxiety/depression (i.e., before they can guarantee supporting your FMLA, prior to this, they just have to be open to it in principle).These RFL EAP psychotherapists only have a Master's degree, and may want to upsell you to a psychiatrist for FMLA, who is a real MD; politely refuse, because it's not required to get an FMLA/STDI approved at Amazon.They may also upsell you to weekly sessions; note that it's been officially confirmed by many Amazonians that biweekly is sufficient, but it's between you and your therapist on what the appropriate treatment for your condition may be.3. Call RFL EAP again. Tell them you picked provider X, setup an appointment for date Y. Obtain the authorization code from RFL EAP; give this code to provider, code is good for 3 free sessions per issue (life event) per plan year, valid for 120 days. There's no copay. But give your main insurance info anyways, to ensure you get full discount after EAP runs out.TBD: after the 3 free sessions from EAP are over, you could either obtain authorization for an additional 3 sessions if it's a different issue (supposedly we get a total of 25 sessions at RFL EAP per a representative!), or use the health insurance to pay for additional sessions (after meeting deductible and copay).FORMS: you get forms from Amazon DLS emailed to your personal email address a few days after applying for a Medical LOA; it's a single ~20-page PDF file with a 3-page or a 1-page form within, plus a cover letter for the form (ignore the letter). You get a minimum of 14 days AFTER the start of any leave period to submit the forms; DLS may also offer extensions (esp. for the initial submission). Email the relevant pages of the form to your therapist before the second session; ask them to fill it out during the second session. Many Amazonians have had issues with therapists not returning the forms promptly.WA/CA/NY/etc FORMS: the leave is paid at exactly 60% of base, directly by Amazon payroll, in any state where the FMLA is an unpaid leave; in WA/CA/NY/etc, the leave is paid at up to 60% by Amazon STDI, less the state-specific benefits. Note that Amazon's STDI and WA FMLA is pretax, so you still have to pay taxes on the income as if it was regular salary; however, CA-SDI is generally tax-free. State-specific benefits have their own forms which you must obtain directly from the state on your own.COST/Frugality: you get the first 3 sessions for free from RFL EAP, there's no copay, and this works regardless which insurance plan you have. After that, unless you get EAP to switch issues and cover more sessions, or a new year starts, you pay through insurance, or out of pocket. Example: HSA plan has a 1.5k deductible; each session may cost $110 through insurance, or $140 cash. You'll be paying $110 per session until you reach 1.5k deductible for the plan; after that you only pay 10% of $110. (If you go for a psychiatrist, those cost $300+ per visit, since they're real MDs.)TIMING 1: Focus: best not to use FMLA during Focus, best to save all of this for Pivot Entry. You can take FMLA at any time before failing Pivot Appeal. If your manager plans to PIP you on December 1, taking FMLA on November 1, you lose 1 month of full salary, so, simply wait for Dec 1 unless you really can't stand Amazon no more, or unless you already have a 2x offer from another company.TIMING 2: Pivot: after you get the PDF with the Pivot Entry, you have a few days to decide whether you want to take severance or improve. If you Improve, you get one or two months to Improve according to plan. If you do absolutely nothing, manager can cut the Improve short, moving you directly to Pivot Appeal; if you're working diligently, there's little chance of this happening, even if deadlines are missed. If you fail Pivot, you have the option to do a Pivot Appeal. There's empirical evidence of folks successfully taking FMLA right after failing the Pivot; then coming back from the 12w leave straight to do the Pivot Appeal, and winning the Pivot Appeal. If you win Pivot Appeal, supposedly you can then resign w/o any no-rehire plan, and take the Tier 1 severance.STDI: don't confuse your therapist with disability benefits; FMLA itself is a lot to handle. Outside of WA/CA/NY/etc, you get disability benefits on the side, there's no separate paperwork (at least not with Amazon, no idea about WA and CA paperwork). Some people did report getting slightly different extra forms to fill out for STDI. Generally, each form gets you up to 60 days of leave if filled out properly by a therapist, and a single form can approve both FMLA and STDI.DURATION: You can get this protected leave for up to 12 weeks through FMLA after 12 months of tenure. You could additionally get this up to 26w through Amazon's own Medical LOA (total is 26w, only first 12w is FMLA). Amazon cannot fire you during FMLA 12w; it's unclear whether Medical LOA affords you such benefit or not (EDIT: probably still protected because of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), since your leave can only play a 0.0% role in a termination).Q: Do I have to have been employed for 12 months to qualify?A: Nope! Looks like Medical LOA / STDI is available right after one day of tenure. However, to play it safe, and avoid losing the severance, it's best to first try to Improve on Pivot before taking the leave, to avoid the possibility of being fired right away on return in case Medical LOA doesn't protect you.Q: does adjustment disorder quality for more than 12w?A: no idea. Please let us know if you find out.Q: do I get paid?A: PAY: STDI covers up to 60% of base salary, up to 11w for 12w FMLA leave, and up to 25w for 26w total Medical LOA. You take Medical LOA, FMLA, and STDI concurrently. FMLA expires after 12w. STDI starts 1w late. STDI and Medical LOA expire 26w (182d) after the start of the leave. (After 26w, an LTDI becomes a possibility, but that's administered by an external insurance agent.)Q: vacation, personal, sick time?A: in California: select to use 40hrs of time when applying for the leave, because first week is unpaid by STDI.A: outside California: select ALL of personal + sick time to apply to for the leave (e.g., all of 48h or 96h, depending on state), because it simply expires otherwise; if less than 40hrs of personal+sick time, select up to 40hrs of vacation time (vacation bucket is fully paid out on separation, up to 160h in most states).A: both: you select this with DLS when you apply, you don't report this at timeoff amazon com at all. Also, per coordination of benefits documentation, the STDI is not reduced for PTO redemption, so you can cashout all of your PTO when taking a leave.Q: RFL EAP / Aetna / Premera?A: note that I do recommend finding a therapist through ResourcesForLiving EAP, not PsychologyToday. However, once you do find it, if you want the paperwork completed, you have to be open about paying them through insurance, not through the free EAP. They reportedly only get $50 from RFL EAP (at zero cost to you) [and even less from some other EAPs for the non-Amazonians reading this], but $110 from Aetna/Premera (often at 10% to 100% cost to you, depending on whether the deductible has been met); hence EAP clients are their lowest priority; since noone likes half a TC. Keep this in mind when you negotiate, and always mention you have both EAP as well as Aetna/Premera insurance (or, if Kaiser, you may have to be open to paying extra cash, for forms and/or sessions). So, why use RFL EAP at all? First of all, it guarantees the therapists found through the RFL EAP phone representatives are qualified and vetted; second, there's a higher likelihood they accept new patients if they're potentially willing to take half the rate. And even if you do pay $150 cash per session if Kaiser HMO lets you down, you still get a nice return from that 60% STDI.If you take any non-FMLA Medical Leave while on a Pivot, please let us know whether it pauses Pivot successfully. There's no documentation available whether Amazon has an issue firing people who are on a non-FMLA medical leave. They cannot fire you during FMLA, and they have to stop the deadline timer during FMLA, too; but it's unclear whether non-FMLA also affords any such protections (DLS may claim you cannot be fired during Medical LOA, but it's unclear whether they know the policy or not). EDIT: it appears that a {Medical LOA} / {ADA Leave as an Accommodation} (are these the same or different?), should still protect your job, because your disability can only play a 0.0% role in a termination; worst case, even if your position is eliminated, your leave is still supposed to be honored, and you'll simply be terminated only after you come back and there's no job (this is described for Personal LOA, which doesn't protect the position, it's probably unlikely to happen with a Medical LOA).#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #amazonbenefits #amazonfocus #amazonpivot #amazonpip #focus #pivot #pip #pipped #stdi #fmla",,12/19/2021,37,3142,40,Therapist Issue,Stress

Microsoft,goosfraaba,Going back to India,"See this post as the ramblings of a man who has mixed emotions about leaving USA for good. I came to the US in 2013 and achieved a lot financially and career wise that most immigrants my age wouldnt have achieved. My partner and I bring in ~600k yearly from our full time jobs. In the last 7 yrs we became US Citizens, travelled the world, bought 3 homes in the eastside, started a small business on the side, built a $2.5m stock/crypto portfolio. Its was rewarding and humbling and apart from traveling we have lived frugally saving as much as we can. Until kids and covid, we were just doing great! However the last 2 yrs changed us completely. My mother fell sick (Cancer)and is being taken care of by a home nurse, my 2 close family members passed away and i couldnt even see them due to covid restrictions, my kids dont know anyone but us and doesnt bond with our family in india because they have barely seen them. My mothers helpless situation of not having her only son and grandkids around her at her old age when she is sick makes me upset. My kids not knowing my mother or other family and not bonding with her makes me miserable. Having kids made me realize how important it is to have family around and how much our parents do for us. Most days i feel so empty and robotic doing my job and being mentally exhausted. I realized that my spouse is also homesick and wants to have her parents around. We tried getting them here and sponsoring their GC but we know they wont be happy being away from their homes and extended families.Microsoft has graciously agreed to support our move back. I had plans for myself and my family here but its all changed now. I think i have enough to retire when i go back but i just turned 40 and know that a month without working will drive me nuts and hence i will continue to work for some more years. I hope this will make our family happy and get my kids to understand our roots and values. I hope my mother will live the rest of her life in peace with us around. Maybe later when my kids are old enough i will come back.. who know where life takes us!TC 350k",350000,10/26/2021,54,2679,49,Indians Issue,Others

I constantly feel like I never have enough money, material goods, datesetc. I’m not really a materialistic person, so I personally am more a victim of the paper chase 💸. This problem is then further exacerbated by the fact that everyone’s financial worth is displayed on social media platforms (Blind is that place for us Software engineers). Now the problem for me and for many other is, despite this abundance, a lot of us are depressed, stressed, and in very low vibrational states. All in all, financial and material abundance only makes us happy temporarily.Okay, with that said, how does one find happiness, stability, tranquility, and/or joy in life?

Amazon,nh008,Need help!,"Hi everyone,I married my wife 6 yrs ago. We have a 3 yr old son. She moved to US after marriage. She is an introvert. She is an excellent mother and an amazing partner. Supported me throughout my career. She struggled finding work and after my son was born she dedicated 100% of her time towards him. Off late I am very disturbed by her random assumptions about me. She says that someone is out there to put me in danger and someone is following her when she drives. She assumes that my old manager is following me secretly. The worst part is she hasn’t met him at all. He doesn’t even know about us. She tries to connect randoms things and arrives at the same conclusion at the time. For eg: There were pest control folks doing their job outside my house. She thinks they are not pest control folks and they are guys hired by someone to monitor us. She once got a GPS detector and used it to find if there were any GPS devices attached to our car. I have been trying to convince her to visit a doctor. The moment I take up that conversation she starts crying. She thinks I have lost trust in her. I am very worried about her. She used to assume random stuff before as well but I did not pay any heed to it as they were very rare. The last 1 month has been crazy at home. It pains to see her when she starts these random conversations which are far from reality. I am not sure if this is schizophrenia. I just can’t convince her to visit a doctor. I can’t or don’t have the courage to talk about this with friends or family. I am hoping to visit a doctor myself and tell about the situation. Just trying to reach a wider audience via blind to see if someone can guide me here.

Amazon,wawY45,PSA: do not meet toxic micromanaging managers once you go into FMLA during PIP,"It seems common that Amazon managers would still schedule ""final"" meetings with you once you're already on an FMLA (a federally protected leave of absence in the US).They may try to give as justification the fact that the leave is sudden (note that anxiety/depression doesn't require the 30d notice that may be required otherwise for an LOA), or hasn't been approved by the Amazon DLS yet (you have a minimum of 14 days after the start of a leave period to submit paperwork).Do not attend without being cleared by HR. Immediately notify the HRBP of the meeting. Any HR person worth their salt should immediately cancel any such random meeting without any agenda.Do not attend unless a clear real emergency is at stake. Do not attend without a clear written agenda for the meeting (that's supposed to be how any meeting should be run in the first place). They're not allowed to bother you with random work. Only emergencies and stuff noone else could possibly know; I can't even think of any example that would apply to anyone L6 or below at Amazon. Amazon is not supposed to fail just because a random person gets hit by a bus.Demand a clear agenda. If you attend, inform Amazon DLS (Disability Leave), and have them count the day you attended as a workday. File an ethics complaint against your manager for knowingly scheduling random meeting in violation of federal law.Missing a deadline because your manager doesn't have the workforce is not an emergency that has anything to do with yourself. It's a failure of management to hire enough people, and treat the people they already do have with due respect.If a manager has been micromanaging you to cause you to have depression and anxiety in the first place, and ignoring your advice to document and delegate, there's hardly a scenario in which attending any such ""final"" meeting (when already on a leave of absence) would make you feel any better in any way. Do not feel guilty for their failure. It's not your fault. You did tell them to document and delegate, they made a call not to, it's their problem now. #tech #burnout #depression #mentalhealth #fmla #loa #pip #amazonpip #amazonfocus #amazonpivot #focus #pivot",,4/22/2022,24,1082,7,Toxic Manager,Burnout
New,Startup$M,How to deal with gaslighting and humiliation by boss?,"Hey all,Unfortunately, this is not my first post of the sort. Several months ago I posted about my abusive boss who gaslighted me and humiliated me in front of the team. You guys told me to start looking around and so I did. Problem is that I didn't manage to get hired elsewhere, I think because I have less than 2yoe and only six months at current startup and was looking mostly at big tech. Got a bunch of referrals and some recruiter calls, but it seems this was exactly as the hiring freezes began. Meta told me I didn't have enough experience... Right after their stock tanked massively. I didn't manage to get any interview. So I just decided to hold steady until I got my rsu, which is still in a few months.It started going great between my boss and I for like a month and a half. He started coming back to me to pitch ideas like he did before. He welcomed my project ideas. He started respecting me as a good engineer again. Until very recently. He basically decided to start gaslighting me and humiliating me again. Telling me my new project should be done by next week even though we kicked it off last week and it's supposed to last a month. He kept telling me in front of everyone that I needed to speed up. I think four our five times within ten minutes. He kept criticizing my design choices in front of everyone out of the blue even though we had gone over the design earlier together and I had already built a prototype that works (and that can easily be scaled back to what he now wants). In front of everyone, he kept tearing into my planning for another project I'm on even though I ran it by him. I just looked at the issues history and he moved the issues back and forth between the sprint and backlog and accused me of bypassing him to introduce scope in the sprints. I feel like he lives in another reality. He accuses me of diverting engineer time even though he did the scoping.What the fuck do I do? The whole tech industry is crashing and I feel like I'm going to be stuck with this shit boss for months or years still.BTW, we have no HR because we're a startup.Blind tax:YOE: 2Base: 120kRSU: probably worthless since the company has no future with a boss like this.#depression #mentalhealth",,5/26/2022,23,519,3,Indians Issue,Mental Health

Snap,idk anymor,Advice: Progressing with a Disability,"I was promoted to L5 and deemed a ""high performer"" in the last promotion cycle, much to my surprise. I didn't request or lobby for myself to get promoted and honestly didn't think it would happen. I'm pretty quiet and keep to myself vs my peers.However, I am very hardworking because I need to compensate for my disability. My disability affects my ability to process info, listen, communicate, and understand social cues. So I work long hours to make up for my shortcomings. I've never disclosed this to my team/manager, so I'm not sure they are aware of this, but I wouldn't be surprised if they can sense that I'm different.Now that I have been promoted I have direct reports and I am asked to join higher level discussions with more senior leaders. With these higher expectations, I'm finding it really difficult to mask my disability like I used to. Before, I could work late into the night to read a review and work independently. But now I have to be always-on, in the moment and this is not something that comes natural for me.Does anyone with a disability have advice on how they've been able to progress in the corporate world as expectations get higher and higher?

AstraZeneca,7.$383hdd,Decided to quit...,"Hey, I'm just putting this out here because the Blind community has been very helpful to me.I'm a principal level data/ research scientist at Astrazeneca and have decided to quit my role without another role lined up. Some of the reasons are1. They needed me to move to MD and I want to stay in CA. We bought a home here last year and also I like the vibe of California. Since my direct manager was in UK, all of my team mates are in UK, and maybe one or two in MD, I was starting my days at 4am/6am for meetings. Tried to make it work but it was affecting my health and didn't seem like a long term solution.2. Interviewing has been really hard because the job demanded a lot. I want the next role to be something that I'm excited about, and not something that I take to fill up space on my resume which I would end up doing if I don't give time to interviews- for this I need to interview with lots and lots of companies. Dont have time for that while working full time with the obligations of my level.3. I do mostly ML research/ product on the role and my LC skills could use some refresh.4. I had a two cycles of IVF and a third one happening now. I need my stress levels to be low else this one isn't going to work either.5. We just closed in on a home in December and I've savings for N months if I don't work, where we can manage on one income. I put down almost all my liquid cash to cover most down payment so partner can pick up mortgage while I transition.My last date is end of month. I plan to see if the IVF succeeds, take time off to see my family, do a yoga retreat to help my body heal from these cycles, lots of meditation and music, travel, clear my head and of course LC/ side project whatever.I'm looking to start a new role in May around.QuestionHas any of you done this before? If yes what advice do you have for me? I'm sure I'm going to go through many moments of frustration/ doubt in next few months - could use lots of support.

If so, how supportive were they? And how long did you know these people.Personally I have shared my struggle (anxiety) and my enrollment in therapy in fair detail with one of my high school friend, after he inadvertently mentioned that he’s been going to therapy. Since we’ve had a good understanding over many years, I felt comfortable sharing details with him. However he lives in a different state and time zone and we speak once maybe once in 2 weeks as we’re mostly busy with our own lives and struggles.I’m really apprehensive about sharing anything with my local friends, as they are all pretty recent friends (known them for little more than a year), and we haven’t spoken about each other’s life struggles in great details (they all have local friends whom they have known since childhood). Also due to the same reason, I don’t feel too comfortable sharing anything as they might feel weird that I’m sharing my struggles after knowing them for not too long.TC- 180k#mentalhealth",,8/11/2022,10,356,3,Others,Anxiety

Microsoft,rayban99,Faced harassment/bullying at a grocery store. What should I do ??,"A few hours ago, I took a normal trip to a local grocery store with my wife and daughter (both were waiting in the car), about 15 minutes before midnight. There, I had a very bad encounter with another person who got extremely abusive towards me. He called me all kinds of things and used the F word at least 2 dozen times !!Here's what happened: I was standing behind him in the checkout lane. The queue was long so the store people opened another adjacent counter lane and announced that that lane is now also open. I quickly moved to that lane as I was in a hurry. This person who was in front of me in the previous lane, felt that I crossed him as he also was waiting to start his checkout, and also wanted to move to the new lane. Anyway, when I moved to the new lane, he got abusive towards me and told me to move back. I said I moved to the new line first, and then started swearing at me with the F word several times. I didn't say anything again and let him pass me. He checked out, and as he was leaving, he started swearing at me again with the F word and whatnot. At this time, I got pissed and used the F word against him, but just ONCE! He heard it, and came back up the aisle and stood right in front of me to taunt me, and again started using even more abusive language. I didn't say anything. The store clerks started yelling at him to back off, but he didn't immediately back off. Ultimately when he did back off, I checked out, completely shaken. But then when I went outside the store, to my surprise I saw him waiting for me there !!! He AGAIN started cursing extremely bad words at me, which I won't even say to my worst enemy. He taunted me to 'make a move' since now we're outside the store. When I didn't, he called me a 'p***y' and said he'll 're-arrange' my face if I said anything, all the while using the F word against me another dozen times. I didn't say a word, because my wife and daughter were waiting for me in my car, and I didn't want to put them or myself in danger. My wife was in the car, and managed to catch a glimpse of what happened as well.Anyways, this incident has completely shaken me and despite my best effort, I'm unable to look over it. After I left the car park, I parked at another spot for 5-10 minutes to gather myself. Then I drove back to the grocery store where this incident occurred, by which time this person had left. I talked to the clerk who checked him and me out. He said that I can call the police and he'll happily give a statement, but he also said that I 'started' the issue because when I moved to the new lane, I broke a 'social construct' when I 'bypassed' him. He also said that then I used the F word against him, to which the person responded. I told the clerk that that other person swore many times at my first, but for some reason the clerk didn't recall didn't recall that. He said that since 'no violence' had occurred, the police will most likely not do anything, based on his experience in dealing with them many times before. But he can still file the statement if I want to involve the police.Anyway, I have some questions:1) Is the store clerk right ? Did I really break a 'social construct' when I moved the new line quicker than this idiot who was in front of me in the PREVIOUS line ? How would I know that he also wants to move to the new line ??2) And even if the store clerk's right, does it justify the *extremely abusive* language this person used against me, taunted me and then threatened to hurt me outside the store ??3) Do I have any justifiable harassment case against this guy, or not ?4) What should I do next, if anything ?5) I'm feeling very overwhelmed by this incident. I faced a another very abusive bullying incident once as a child, that was actually quite similar to this one, and this brought back memories of that. I've faced depression many times in my life because of similar incidences, and other things. I've talked to many therapists and psychiatrists over the last 10 years so, but am not seeing anyone these days. Is there any 'hotline' where I can immediately talk to a counselor or therapist, to help me digest this incident and come to terms with it, without having to go through the whole nine yards of finding a therapist, getting an appointment and then talking to him/her ?

Amazon,dopplerton,Life is hitting a wall...,"I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try my best.I'm a 26 yr old male, recently got promoted - I'm an ambitious individual who likes to work hard, but also have fun in life (traveling, spending on fancy toys, clothes & food). I am not much of a movies person, but I like to stay physically and socially active.Lately, one of my parent was diagnosed with a life threatening illness and is on constant medicines & regular doctor visits. I'm the only child and my parents are in their late 40s, almost 50.The morale of home is very negative, filled with sadness and constant medical care as if half of my family's time gets spend on dealing with sickness. I look at other folks who are my age and being able to live life where as I'm weighed down by job stress + pressure (money becomes a lot more important when someone close to you is dealing with life threatening sickness) & especially if you come from a lower middle class financial background.My parents want me to get married, but I am not able to take out time to go on dates as there are way too many responsibilities & everything happening is making me sad and empty, questioning the purpose of life. With this mindset, no girl will wanna be with me - I don't have the energy that I once used to as a 22 year old when it came to girls and dating. I used to get every other girl interested in me if I made the effort back then, but these days I am not able to meet people, dating apps suck, and I just don't know where to start. My parents talk about arrange marriage, but why would any girl want to marry a guy who's youth is filled with so much tension, sadness & responsibilities. As this is the situation, I'd also end up living with my parents so I think of, why would a girl want to move in with a guy where she'll constantly be also just taking on more responsibilities? I spoke with few girls from shaadi who first seem interested in me because I have one of the most attractive profiles, but they all of a sudden stop showing interest when I tell them about the health condition in our family.I feel my life has come to a standstill; I'm not sure how to cheer my parents up - they tell me about their worries and problems as they have no one, but I can't speak to anyone about the struggles I'm facing. I try to just keep my head and keep checking on things because they need to be done as I think that's just life, but my soul has died and my youth feels taken away from me (I may feel more so because most of all the guys I know in my age group are having fun with their lives, either lack of responsibilities or born with a silver spoon, but most importantly, they don't have to worry about their parents at such a young age) - while I may be sounding like I'm complaining, I'm grateful & privileged on multiple levels - but not sure how to break out of this negative loop.I'm also juggling with my career as I accompany on doctor visits or get pulled into phone calls from doctors - sometimes I attend meetings from the hospital, but don't end up contributing much, just drop in the call and try to listen as much as I can.

I’m aiming for a backend engineer or full stack because I find joy when I build things. My problem is my current experience. I’m applying to Junior roles and still struggling. I find myself always reassuring recruiters/hiring managers that I do code but what’s hurting me is my experience isn’t what they need. Also, Ive had little opportunities to grow or have had little mentorship at my job. Also the interviews have been my blocker. I put hours into them but I just can’t seem to get through a problem, except on some rare occasions given the question has a similar or related trick/technique/pattern I’ve come across or I’m able to find the data structure to use.After work, I’m extremely burnt out and I try to put in as much time but I feel so overwhelmed with what I need to learn.

Amazon,wawY45,Does America have better employee protections for Mental Health Medical LOA than the rest of the world?,"It's very common to see Amazonians ask for an FMLA equivalent in the rest of the world, but somehow there's never an answer.In the US, your #mentalhealth Medical LOA and job security is actually guaranteed not just by FMLA, but by ADA, too.It turns out ADA may actually provide more protection compared to FMLA in some circumstances; for example, it's ADA that requires placement into the specific old position, provided it's not a hardship for employer, whereas FMLA allows placing you into a similar job. ADA also allows your leave to exceed 12w, so FMLA can actually be viewed as a much narrower benefit that's considerably inferior to the ADA protections. FMLA can be viewed as a smoke screen to mislead people into thinking their leave has to end in 12w. It is often openly explained that a leave exceeding FMLA even by 1d is no longer protected by FMLA, but this is very misleading, because ADA may already provide a better protection to start with.Also, FMLA, when combined with a Medical LOA for your own illness, is almost always paid by the bigger employers, because it's insured through an STDI. So it'll only be unpaid if you're taking care of family. Parental Leave is likewise often paid through STDI.#burnout #depression #amazonbenefits #amazonpip",,5/29/2022,22,361,1,Family Issue,Burnout

He wakes up, drops off kids, work, pick up kids and watch some tv shows and go to sleep. He is a great dad, husband and an employee. But outside of those roles, he doesn’t exist.I think at this point of my life the happiness is something I get from daily small things like my kid’s cuddle and a nice long walk in a sunny day. My life is the same, I wake up, take care of kids, work and feed/wash kids and sleep. But I don’t think I am depressed. Life is alright, happy and healthy family, nothing else to ask for really. Of course I wanted to change the world and make something to be remembered when I was younger. But I think I learned to find joy from everyday things.He also said that he doesn’t have anything just for himself. No hobby that he is passionate about. But at the same time he can’t really think of anything that he wants either, which bothers him in return again. He feels sad that he doesn’t even know what he wants and he lost his identity.Sometimes he says he would try something. But then he says that he has some interests here and there but he doesn’t do anything right or follows through. He is the most brilliant, kind and persistent person I know and it is heartbreaking that he acts this way.He is a loving dad and a husband. He is a very witty and funny person with a lot of friends who fond of him. Honestly nobody would believe that he feels this way. But I think he feels the most of friends are superficial work/school network. He doesn’t think he has real friends.We recently bought a house too. So far, there was always something to worry about and get stressed over like job, house or whatever. I think recently we have achieved a lot and I think he might feel a bit losing focus after achieving things he wanted (jobs, house, family).Though I have gone through some buyers remorse and I think it impacted negatively on him that he is thinking he doesn’t do anything right and cant make his spouse happy. He told me he feels also guilty for the decision. I told him over and over that we made the decision together and it is not his fault and overall the decision is still sound. Still it doesn’t matter.I love him deeply and I want him to be happy. I am worried about him but I am not sure what I should do. Anybody felt this way? And how did you overcome?

New,Sanders99,It's OK to ask for help. #MentalHealth,"Just wanted to throw this out there for anyone needing it.I was burnt out, and hosed by some bait and switch leadership. I wasn't just done with that job....I was done done.Had been in a bad work situation, overworked, underpaid, and not appreciated for years.Eventually I went from an over achiever and 4.5/5 employee to underperformed, missing deadlines, and getting sick a lot.I had fleeting thoughts of the world and my family [wife and kids] being better off without me.Finally I opened up to the wife...and got in with a male counselor. He helped me talk through things and get me on some meds.The meds helped with the dread of life...and the suicidal thoughts, but they could only do so much. So I knew what I had to do. I survived for another month and finished up a huge project, and turned in my notice with no new job lined up.I quit that job...and spent much needed alone time, and LOTS of time with the family.I ended up taking a full 7 months off to focus on my mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health. It recharged me more than I could have ever imagined. Between that, and some meds to help, and getting out of a toxic workplace, I was able to go back anew into the workforce, recharged.I just recently went off the meds, and wrapped up counseling.Some days are still tough but nothing like they were.I encourage you all, ESPECIALLY MEN, to find someone neutral you can talk to and be open to. [If in a serious relationship, avoid a counselor or mentor of the same gender as your SO if you can, to avoid developing an accidental relationship!! It happens more then youd think.]Whether a counselor or mentor. Spend some down time away from screens to do self checkup on your mental state. Be OK getting help!TLDR:Toxic workplace with abuse and bait and switches killed my mental health and caused full scale depression taking me from a Rockstar to dead weight professionally and personally.Seek help, counseling, meds, an extended work break..whatever it takes.

Amazon,EpSQ61,Severe Mood disorder made exponentially worse by WFH,"(This is a somewhat long rant. Please be patient.)Does anyone else have a severe mood disorder and still have trouble adjusting to a life where you WFH?I’m bipolar I, and the only thing that’s historically been able to drag me out of bed previously was the fear of job loss and homelessness. School and college provided the same forcing function for me, a forcing function which is now gone and unlikely to come back ever. Leaving the house on a regular basis gave me a sense of being somewhat normal.I’ve wrestled with my mood disorder for 20 years now, so it’s not new.The problem with my condition is that, historically, as soon as I get better thanks to external factors or medication, it leads to intense euphoria/mania or psychotic symptoms in the worst case.Imagine staying awake for 30/40 hours straight with no ability to sleep more than 3 hours afterwards, where all you do is read books, code or papers, and search for clues and hidden meaning, until you either lose touch with reality, or fall into a severe depressionTherapy isn’t helpful, because there’s nothing I can pinpoint to that makes me suicidal or highly euphoric other than something being physiologically off with my brain.I’ve tried most medication, including psychedelics. LSD had by far the best outcome, but it’s hard to come by. The only thing I haven’t tried is electroconvulsive shock therapy.Essentially, I feel like WFH has taken away the only mechanism I’ve had for 20 years that kept me from falling off a ledge.I don’t know how to deal with this, and I don’t know how to have a conversation with my manager about my condition. The problem is I don’t see a possible solution, in which case, is it even worth bringing it up?Also, because of Bipolar I, even though I’m fully competent intellectually, I cannot maintain consistency with regards to my output. In Amazon lingo, I cannot consistently meet the bar. The only hope I have is to make up for it during manic episodes.This is doable for L5, but I’d argue it’s not for L6. With that in mind, I don’t think I’m emotionally fit to be an L6 ever in my career (1 year from now or 20 years from now) , and no mentorship or resources are going to make a difference (the same way you’re not fit for the military if you have a mental illness).

I did individual therapy with MSCares for three months but I didn't feel very connected with the therapist. In July I started couples therapy with my boyfriend which improved our relationship a lot. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression. And I started taking Duloxetine since August which helped with my emotions and back pain. I started cognitive behavioral therapy on Lyra starting October and it was amazing! I found a therapist that connected with me very well and I'm glad that I can be vulnerable and share everything I wanted. My boyfriend has been the biggest help along my mental health journey.

More importantly I'm on a visa & in the green card process so I can't easily switch jobs. I feel trapped.I do love Microsoft and love my team.

Amazon,N00bGrad,Chronic lower back pain pushing me to a dark place...,"Some context: Male, 22yo. In July 2021 I was squatting in the gym and I felt some sudden lower back pain. Stopped my set, shrugged it off, and tried to relax. It wasn't too bad but I definitely wasn't 100% after a few chiropractor sessions, but I pushed through it and continued going to the gym and my BJJ classes. During one of the classes in late August 2021 I really hurt it again, super intense pain it hurt to do literally anything. I decided to take my recovery more seriously and stopped going to the gym or BJJ; went to another physio.This has been a never-ending rollercoaster of pain and disappointment. Some weeks are ok, most are bad. At one point I was doing better and I went to a new physical therapist to get me to 100% -- he suggested all these hamstring stretches that ended up bringing back sciatica and back pain. I've been consistently walking, doing McGill big3 stretches, and avoiding sitting or driving as much as possible. On my best days, I don't have sciatica and if I am standing or lying on my stomach I have 0 pain, but after sitting/driving for ~30 minutes I feel pain. I don't attempt to do any deadlift motions as it hurts like hell and is very weak.I was a super active and fit guy, working out and athletics was something that kept me healthy and sane. I feel useless and weak now, like I can't do simple things like sit through a long dinner or drive more than ~20 minutes without being in pain. I don't know what to do, I try to stay positive as much as I can but if this is what life will be like I can't do it. I want to marry my girlfriend and start a family, I want to travel and play sports and lift weights. But I feel like I can't.Does anyone have any perspective on chronic lower back pain? I have an MRI scheduled soon but I can't see it telling me anything I don't already suspect (herniated disc). I've been thinking a lot more about suicide lately and I don't want to but I also can't do this nonstop pain and weakness. #chronicpain #depression #backpain",,1/11/2022,51,822,7,Family Issue,Others

Toyota,rmOL74,Working Under A Micromanaging Boss Is Starting To Affect Me Mentally,"I recently started working with Toyota and was placed in a team that needed a Data Analyst who could learn more about the data that the team was working with, find an alternative to Excel that would house this data and work with it as needed. Now mind you, I literally joined this team knowing exactly 0 about anything regarding what this team did and how it worked and so the natural first step would be to get a hang of what is going on, how the stakeholders use the data, business requirements, etc. Then plan out a schema and then start searching / building.That's when I noticed the first signs of trouble. The person I was working under began delegating me tasks alongside my original task. This in itself is not a problem but I noticed that as soon as she delegated a task less than 2 - 3 hours later she would be asking me questions about how I was working on it or offering up ways to do it. It seemed harmless at first but then she would essentially start doing part of the task or the whole task she delegated and then explaining to me how to do it next time.Now, as someone who is fresh into a company working on multiple projects at a time, I expected a certain level of autonomy with the tasks given to me and in general I think everyone has their own way of going about doing things. I have never dealt with a situation where a senior delegates something to me and then within hours essentially finds that I am not doing it the ""right way"" and starts doing it themselves or hovering over me as I learn ways to do the task.Over time it got worse and worse and by the third month I essentially realized that I was dealing with a micromanager. If she gives me a task it has to be done in the way she thinks is most efficient, in the time she thinks is best to do it, and prioritized in the way she thinks is best. I would wake up and get on at 7 AM on a Tuesday to find her hovering in my docs, changing things up and messages regarding what I should be doing for the day, despite the fact that I had essentially already planned out my day.At this point I am almost 6 months in and I essentially feel like I am working with little to no autonomy and just being thrown at one task after the other, expected to do it in ""her way"" as quickly as possible while the original reason I felt I joined this company has been essentially thrown to the bushes.I like the company, the job pays well, and honestly if I wasn't working under her I feel I would be very happy with the role but this situation is starting to affect my mental health and makes me dread signing into work some mornings as I know as soon as I jump on, she will be sitting there in my sheet just tearing everything apart and putting it back together in the way she prefers....#mentalhealth #drainingboss #micromanager",,5/20/2022,18,513,6,Toxic Manager,Mental Health
Salesforce,mindhunt0,Surprised I’m still alive,I was in a very bad place last year. I would think about suicide every other day. It was very amusing because I did not have any problems. I was doing great in school. I didn’t struggle to land a job. I had a great group of friends/acquaintances who even if not super close where good people who wished me well.The only problem was that I was not happy. Nothing gave me joy.Majority of my life has been this way. But I could always attribute the lack of happiness to some problem. So I worked harder to overcome that problem. Now I had everything I wanted and still felt this way. That put me in a very bad mental state.

But even that wasn't without a story. Initial offer was for $200k, and they verbally promised giving me $250k after ""probation period"" when I was signing the offer. Then COVID hit, they changed their mind, blablabla. They praised me for my work last summer and were talking about promoting me, but once they announced the numbers, I felt being tricked.

This is more like the squid games where there are groups of people(its mostly single person projects and probably 2 in most cases) who are working on their own small projects and all trying to win individually.Most of the feedback people will give you is during the time where one would think 'this would have made a good question early on during the process instead of asking it right now in front of 15 other people and trying to prove that you know more than the person who has been working on that project .' Questions have turned into arguments and have to be stopped multiple times as well.I can keep on writing here because I have way too many incidents/situations to share that I find really confusing. I can't point to specific things anymore.This is the first place that has rewarded me with promotions and considerable raise for my hard work instead of telling me that I did really good but 1-2% was the best they could do for now .I don't know why but i am okay with not getting more and more money /recognition as long as I am happy working with the people on the team. I have never asked for more and always thought that good things will come to you in time if you do your part but I don't think that is true anymore.I just feel like quitting today but the thought that this will take some time is driving me nuts. I don't know if i made myself hate this job for no reason. Finding it difficult to concentrate on studying as I keep getting distracted, trying to look into things that people are having problems with because I like to work on such problem.God why I am I so messed up and all over the place. I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore. :(Edit: if folks have any recommendations for a team /company where I might be a fit, please let me know.#mentalhealth #officelife #culture #depression",,4/14/2022,14,908,17,Others,Mental Health

Johnny Depp life looks like a movie and full of life with all the pain , happiness.I am just alone, dumb, struggling to even complete office work. Don't have any confidence about anything in my life. I just see movies all the time and other talk shows and feel happy when I see how cool they are. This is the only happiness I have right now. I develop crush on someone personality at a time, keep watching their movies or videos. Once I am bored, there is period where I feel too lonely and then I usually develop crush on some other celebrity or someone who is not reachable in real life. I don't feel lonely because I am completely involved in their voice, looks, acting, researching about their personal life. At that point, there is immense desire to meet them and talk to them. This is how I am spending my entire life for more 10 years without actually feeling lonely all the time. It just sucks when I realize that in reality I am very lonely. It just makes me happy and feel better than I tried to connect with people in real life.I don't expect anything for you to say.

Amazon,dalydog,Lost my job at Google and almost everything after my mother died suddenly. I don’t feel like living anymore.,"For the past 2 years, I was a contractor at google. The first few months were rough but about 6 months in I started to excel. My last 18 months at google, I exceeded my production goals every quarter and interviewed for a full time job. Two of my former leads offered to be references along with three FTE colleagues who worked with me directly.Then a perfect storm struck. My young, healthy mother fell off of a balcony, was in a coma for 2 weeks, and died the week I was originally supposed to have my final round after we took her off of life support. My interview was rescheduled at the last minute two weeks later and I only had a few days to prepare. The whole time I was dealing with my mother’s accident was when I was supposed to be at work and preparing for my final rounds. I didn’t have as much time as I hoped. Since I was a contractor, I want paid during the 3 weeks I was watching after my mother across the country—an $800 one way ticket the day she fell. On top of this, my lease was ending and I moved to a new apartment. Between the accident, moving expenses, and being out of work for a month, I lost all of the money I had saved over the last 4 years in about 30 days.I made it to HC and they requested one more round. I did the final round and was rejected during my second review in HC. Whether or not it came down to the final round, I’m quite sure I would have done better during my on-site before the first HC if it weren’t for my mother’s death. Before the accident my recruiter told me “you’ll probably do well and get hired since most contractors do.”Overall, I’m now dealing with the loss of my mother and my job at Google which I loved. Two huge losses, one right after the other. I took a contract at Amazon, but am struggling to adjust. Not only am I overwhelmed by these major life changes in such a short amount of time, my health insurance doesn’t kick in for another three months. On top of being unable to find a therapist, I have a neurological condition that i need medication for and I can’t see a doctor until after my first 90 days. Kind of ironic how I’m expected to make my best first impression during this time as well.Overall, I’m really struggling with my first few months at Amazon. My new coworkers don’t know me. I’m starting this new job during the worst time of my life and am struggling to meet their expectations. They don’t understand what I’m going through but can I blame them? I don’t even know myself.Also, I’m so ashamed of not getting the job at google I’m afraid to stay connected with my fellow TVCs who got hired.Overall, I feel like I’ve lost everything and no one understands or cares. I poured my heart and soul into Google just to be rejected despite my 2 years of solid performance and internal references vouching for me.What’s the point of even trying at Amazon now? Trying at life in general? My family lives thousands of miles away. I live on my own. Every morning I wake up wishing I wasn’t alive and I don’t feel like I have anywhere to turn.UPDATE: Thank you all for the encouragement and support! I took a job at MSFT and am so much happier. Making MUCH more than I was at google (105k to 135k tech recruiter).Hope this post and comments will help someone else going through hell someday.

Shopify,Dr.Downer,Feeling low with after tons of rejections and inability to perform in my work and feel happiness,"I started my career with a mediocre company in 3rd world country.All my life I focused only on moving out of poverty and get a better job.Somehow I was able to bump into places where I can learn a little and grow gradually.I had this bad habit of thinking ""The grass is greener on the other side"". Always give low priority to my current place of work and focus on going somewhere better where I will be paid better. Social media like linkedin and places like blind increased my appetite for money, so I end up being a mediocre performer all along.This is the routine I go through,- I set up a big target, failed to reach it, but get a next level job(this was possible since my level at that time was not that high).- Make a good impression in the beginning and lose interest in few months.- Lose the respect I have in my team.- Just do enough work to survive.- Brood about my low pay and prepare again.- Go to stress since I am not able to do better in current work/preparation.- Back to step 1I changed 8 companies in 10 years, courtesy: this infinite loop.I feel like I am going through motions, not getting motivation at all.I have a rough and poverty filled childhood, this somehow fuelled my hunger for money, but the funny thing is, I don't live lavishly and buy fancy things I spend most of my money for my family/parents and charity work.Recently I survived layoffs in Shopify, but somehow I failed to land a big job this time and faced lot of rejections. I feel exhausted and started thinking if I ever be happy again.I am still not sure how can I start enjoying my current work, earn more respect and have a satisfactory career and overall prepare for interviews with fun.

Optum,RSwY88,Family Dynamic Issues when it comes to Money/TC,"Hey Guys, heads up, this might be a long one.My cousins and I grew up very close (Located in Midwest), like we were brothers and sisters. Our parents were immigrants from South East Asia so they were pretty much poor. As we grew up, we learned to love and enjoy each other (Good and Bad). I eventually went to college and finished up. I was very fortunate to also land a job right out of school paying 70k, Super Happy :) Also, I was not the smartest kid in my family, so not much expectations from me. A lot of the attention was focused on the older cousins who were much more mature, or younger ones who had a much brighter future.. Seriously, not even kidding.Some of my other cousins went to school around the same time I did . Some dropped out, others finished but couldn't land a job, and others landed but started at <50k. When I finished school, my grandparents had asked for my salary. I happily told them because I didn't want them to worry, and that they have done everything they could for me (Coming to USA during the Vietnam War, ETC), and that I appreciate everything and wanted them to know that I'm doing Ok.Well, that quickly went upside down. News spread quick. Some family members found out about my salary, and started telling me that I'm rich now. It's cool at first, because we all strive to be that, but now easily getting annoying. AND No, I seriously do not think I'm rich. That's like literally just above avg income in my location. Also, My grandparents do not live with me, they live with my uncle, who one of his kids went to the same school as me and graduated but was finding it tough to land a job right away. He is also one of my closest cousin too.Little did I know, I had created this shadow that I didn't know that would haunt him for years, and that followed to my other cousins who also was in similar situation. Some how, the parents starts telling me that they wished their kids were like me, or that they want their kids to join the company I was at so they can be rich too. They start asking me to help their kids to write up their resume, or tell them my secret to how I made this much. What secret are they talking about, WTF?Things start getting weird. I do want to help them, but I'm trying to focus on myself because I'm barely surviving at work now. Projects are super hard, and I'm working as a SWE with a non CS degree. Every time I make a career suggestion to them though, they seemed a bit annoyed. Makes me think their parents are already giving them an earful, and I'm probably not making this situation better for them. Plus it could just be their parents saying all these to me for them, when they really couldn't care less. (Our parents put a lot of pressure on us to do well in life, so I don't blame them one bit too if they felt annoyed.)Fast forward 5+ years, now making 100k+, and I never revealed my salary to them ever again. I felt so bad, I had good intention when I first got my job because I wanted my elders to know that they don't need to worry about us young folks as we can take care of ourselves.Well, now married, and a kid, we buy ourselves a 500k home. My extended family is really judging now, Cousins, Uncles, Aunties and whoever else. They will literally ask me for the price of my home and once I reveal, will comment ""Dang, that's a half a million dollar home"".It's tough being in a situation where I'm doing my best to take care of myself to put me in a position where I will do well in life (Including my wife and kid), but others will say that I'm too good for them.Sometimes, I don't feel they try to do that for themselves in the best position. Instead they just wish it will happen to them like buying a lottery ticket and hoping you will become a millionaire overnight.They also never say anything bad to me directly, but their attitude def says it. Sometimes they will try to explain something to me, and say ""Money isn't everything"", or ""Those who make more should give more to the family"", and I completely agree with that, but now it just seems that was towards me.I seriously work my butt off to be in this position. Sure I might have been lucky too, but now, sometimes I feel I don't deserve this, because my family doesn't appreciate my growth. In their eyes, it would be way better if I struggled finding a job, or worked minimum wage or something along that line.Breaking 6 figures was a super big milestone for me. Literally everyone in my team is making that or more, so on a daily base, it feels normal.Compared to the Blind Community, I bet my TC is like nothing.I don't want to assume my family is jealous, but I sure feel that. My priorities might be different compared to what theirs are, and I'm far from perfect nor feel even near where I want to be in life. Some of them just want to get wasted every weekend, and that's cool and all. I will join you once in a while, but I wouldn't be able to keep up every weekend lol.But honestly, I'm unsure how I can fix this, or how I can make this better for everyone.As I continue to push my self, my TC will most likely climb, which will only drift me further away from my Family Members.IDK what to do, or if I should just leave as is. This is my family, and I love them to death, but some things might be left untouched. I'm hoping this weird situation that everyone feels, we can all just laugh together someday and at least us cousins can say we were just young and dumb to feel this.TC 140k.",140000,7/21/2022,8,451,6,Family Issue,Others

Novartis,genacc,Need some guidance,Tldr version - feeling extremely disappointed and mental health is suffering due to my perception that my career mobility has become limited.(Detailed post)Folks - I have 18 plus years experience and am currently in Big pharma working as a Strategic business partner/ Program Manager. Prior to this I have worked in Financial services and Management consulting. I have very good performance ratings in my current firm and have a very good track record of being delivery oriented in my experience. My current firm is undergoing a major restructuring and I am trying to get out before it hits me.An additional reason for wanting to get out is that despite having the experience and performance I am not finding promotable opportunities inside. We just went through one reorg and the management structure changed. I was recommended by my previous manager for a higher level role to my current management structure but still they decided to bring someone else in above me despite the person having no track record in this organization and was only known and has worked closely with the current head of the function. This was very disappointing for me but I have now put that aside.The past few months have been disappointing and my mental health is suffering due to the following factors.1. I updated my profile at Linked in but still get no recruiter pings2. I applied to so many roles online but am getting no responses3. I applied to Indeed through a referral here and a recruiter spoke to me and said she will forward resume to the team and I got an email the next next day saying I was not selected to interview4. I applied to positions internally within the firm but am not even being selected to interview. Everytime they tell me there is some other person who is better qualified who they are considering without even interviewing meAt this time I am feeling very demotivated that even after all accomplishments and historically good track record I am unable to find my next role.

Amazon,ntSRtv,Therapist Demands Crying,"I signed up for one of those online counseling platforms when my boyfriend broke up with me. I had been in therapy for a while before, but didn’t have someone during this crisis.I get assigned a boomer aged white guy. He shares with my that he is an ex Christian pastor and his wife left him, so maybe we had something in common. I am agnostic and an Asian American woman, but I just got dumped, so I guess we had that in common.After a few sessions, he gets angry that I’m not showing enough emotion. I said, do you want me to cry…? He said yes, you need to cry otherwise something bad will happen. You’ll just explode. (What?)I shared with him a specific trauma with a high school counselor telling me to quit crying like a little spoiled girl when I was 15. I told him when I was a new hire at Amazon a Sr. SDE offered to mentor me when I struggled to get promoted and his offer made me tear up. My emotion made the Sr. SDE so uncomfortable he left the room. I was embarrassed.Boomer therapist says, tech is toxic. You should be able to cry at work, you need to quit this industry. WTF I’m not giving up my 9 year career that is actually going well and $400k TC because my loser boyfriend dumped me and this loser therapist wants me to cry more. And also I kind of think me crying at work is a problem not a solution?!?!??I decided to end our sessions the next week. In response be said, I’m going to be honest. You’re a very difficult client. I’m not saying that therapy won’t work for you, but if I couldn’t crack you I don’t think anyone will.

Repeatedly told him, certain things are not in our control and we should not emotionally vested in it. For example attend the meeting if you can't afford to skip it or skip it. Not worth to think about it after the fact.2. I asked him if he could get a mentor in office who could help him navigate work situations. He has not acted on it.3. I try to model how to be excited about small things in life. (We have 2 year old and how travelling, expressing and experiencing are important for him)4. In certain cases where he swears I have fought, cried and rationalized with him.The problem is all this happens in a circle. He is not getting enthusiastic about life.

Roche,wbxc51,"Anyone suffering from PTSD after being bullied, after facing workplace mobbing in your previous job?","I faced severe bullying, workplace mobbing two years ago for more than a year. Though quality of my sleep has improved, I still suffer from PTSD and cannot stop blaming myself for allowing so much so much abuse and disrespect to happen to me.After leaving that utterly toxic environment, I read a lot about psychology and realized that I was actually dealing with a covert narcissist, an overt narcissist and a conversational narcissist and I was a victim of narcissistic abuse!Another female coworker or a sociopath to be more accurate, constantly excluded me from the team and stalked me to the bathroom with her passive aggressions knowing that I couldn’t do much as I was already moved to the team that she belonged from another team for having team issues with the two narcissists mentioned above. So when she and members of her cliques took advantage of the situation and started bullying me, I had no choice but let it happen. She used to deny a bug, when explained, she would pretend that she didn’t understand even if there was a clear STR and screenshots attached demanding me to go to her desk to explain. When I did, she totally ignored me when I was talking to her and didn’t give any response, or acknowledgement when I finished. Though she was a lousy junior developer, I was a QA, she always treated me as though I was inferior to her if not like an assistant to her. When the overt narcissist, who I had to work with, raises a bug for her, she would send a big thank you message to him on slack. She treated other developers like kings and used to do everything they asked her to do with as she needed their support technically. basically she made sure that everyone thought she was such a nice person while being so nasty in a very subtle way to me. I caught her searching for me and she ran back to her seat and staring at me with a disgusted face from her seat( so I turned my monitor to vertical orientation so she couldn’t see me) . She would dismiss me during the lunch time if I joined and she asked the overt narcissist not to call me for lunch.Once she stood next to me and called everyone in the office by name calling them for lunch other than me, after coming back, she bragged about that lunch how great it was loudly in case I didn’t hear. Late I knew that it was a team lunch paid by the company!To my surprise , she used to talk to me suddenly when managers were around to show how she got along well with everyone.The overt narcissist would let me do the 80% manual regression in the name of training me w/o creating a ticket. When I finished, he would confirm with me in the private chat then go confirm to the team himself without ever acknowledging my work. This continued for weeks.When we had a difference of opinions in a very small matter, he immediately said “ you are not cooperating!” Without looking at me though I sat next to him. Then He stopped knowledge transferring and continued talking to me without looking at me.One day I came to the office, he called my name “xxx, I am going to assign two tickets to you” with a cold and condescending tone. Since he wasn’t my boss, neither was he a QA lead, though he claimed that role once I was pulled in to work with him, I asked why, he said “because you are a QA.” It ended up another private talk where he pulled me to an office for further shame and guilt. When I was leaving the office seeing he would never see anything wrong in his behavior, he told me : we don’t need two QAs here!In that company, you work for your coworkers not for the company.The covert narcissist took 4 identical screenshots of our slack conversations and attached to a ticket on the Jira board.One coworker who was very close with my boss constantly denigrated, belittled and sidelined me.I also suffered from sexual harassment. I went to HR raising sexual harassment issue and about the issue with the covert narcissist( I let go others as I couldn’t fight with them all). later, I was PIPed despite of me being the top contributor to the project.Though I accepted the PIP, I couldn’t take the continues toxicity in the team with my manager openly dismiss and denigrating me, I ended up resigning without having an offer at hand. My only regret is not leaving that toxic place on my first month.The injustice, disrespect and denigration hunt me from time to time. #workplace #culture",,6/1/2022,15,550,5,Toxic Manager,PTSD

I am second-guessing everything I do, and everyone's intentions.I have tried to focus on every sort of indoor/outdoor activity that I enjoy doing but I keep going back to that state where I just feel trapped, alone, confused, and helpless.I feel like I am slowly losing everything - physical and mental health - friends family - happiness - and sanity and I am not ready for even the next few years of my life.The only time that I am able to share these feelings is when I am smoking.Yes, that is the only disgusting thing that I have managed to be consistent at and yes this started recently. But please don't tell me to stop because I don't know how to put my problems into words without that.I read about FMLA recently and I have thought about that multiple times, and sometimes I think that it might be a way out of all this(or maybe it becomes worse. Just thinking about those possibilities is also difficult). I haven't even mentioned all this to my therapist yet because I struggle with making any sort of requests/demands, I don't know when to stop and take breaks, I don't know how to not let one bad thing ruin all others, I don't know when to say yes/no, I don't know if I deserve anything.

Amazon,wawY45,How do you get a therapist for FMLA promptly?,"How do you get a willing and available therapist for FMLA?It sounds like to get any therapist, there might be a lead time of a few weeks, but to actually get one willing to consider FMLA and do the required paperwork, might be even more cumbersome. How do you find one?Many people on PsychologyToday as well as ResourcesForLiving EAP never return calls and/or aren't even available for new clients at all; you could spend days trying to find a perfect specialist and doing research about credentials, qualifications and reviews, only for them to never bother to call you back, let alone consider the possibility of supporting FMLA. If you get their secretary to take the call, they aren't even aware of what FMLA is, and are only aware of being excused from work simply for the therapy sessions themselves. Other times they just ghost you when they hear FMLA. Even those who agree may have trouble returning the forms promptly, adding extra anxiety.It seems that successfully being able to find an available therapist is itself a test that you're NOT incapable of doing work, which makes the whole process a mockery because if you're truly incapable and really hardcore depressed, you might simply give up and won't be able to gain an approval for any leave with so many obstacles present, and will simply accept being fired, and will likely spend months on unemployment dealing with anxiety/depression on your own time and your own dime, get evicted or deported.

My family doesn’t have any health issues either. Parents are fine and never had any heart, diabetes or any such serious issues.I workout and try to maintain healthy lifestyle. Working out 🏋️‍♂️ atleast 4x a week. I DONT do any recreational drugs or weed or anything else. I do smoke cigarettes but that’s like 1-2 a day and occasionally Juul.All of that changed on evening of July 27 2021 when I came back from gym around 10pm and had my protein shake in milk. As I lay down in my bed my heart started to pound and I could feel like someone was shaking me from within. My heart rate in the Apple Watch topped 145 and for next 5 hours it stayed there until I slept. I woke up and the next day I was back at 124-140.I decided to go to ER, as I felt heart palpitations along with dizziness and occasional numbness in right arm.The first diagnosis was I have GERD and I I may have had acidic reflux due to lying down after drinking the shake. I assumed the same.Went to the gym the next day and my heart rate touched 171.Few days later, I had same problem and my heart rate elevated and stayed above 120-130 window for hours. At the time I got anxious because I didn’t smoke at all since 27th July nor had any caffeine.In 2nd time in ER I by mistake said I was feeling anxious and they started saying oh this must be panic attack.So 2nd diagnosis was panic attack.Eventually I managed to do convince my pcp to get me a heart monitor and cardiologist who did a echocardiogram.The results of echocardiogram came absolutely fine and nothing was discovered. I shared the results with few other cardiologist from Stanford and they said the same.I am still waiting for heart monitor results and would know those soon.Problem is I am fxuked and pretty much grounded with no ability to workout, getting elevated heart rate out of nowhere and just starting to get depressed.I don’t want to go on those anxiety medications until they can confirm why it’s happening.So who do I trust and what do I do?I do have aspergers and social anxiety but after 10-12 years of realization of the above I don’t really put myself in social situations which can make things worse.Tc 280k",280000,9/13/2021,89,2955,9,Family Issue,Depressed

Instacart,beanbug,Thoughts on ABA therapy for autism?,"I'm a mom of a 4 year old girl. My daughter got diagnosed with ASD (level 1) when she turned three. Back then it took a while to process the whole thing. I asked my pediatrician and she suggested ABA therapy. Covid times were rough and options were limited so we scrambled to get her the ABA therapy. She has 20-25 hours of therapy every week. She is verbal and fairly independent but it is difficult to wrangle her to do anything. Even simple things like getting her to describe how her day was at school. Anyway, I think there is a noticeable improvement in her behavior (still not on par with kids her age though). Now I don't know if I should attribute that to the ABA therapy or just general trend of kids growing up.I've started reading more and more about what I can do to help my kid and I came across so many posts that are totally against ABA therapy to a point where they consider it abuse. They are saying it's like conversion therapy and has links to PTSD in the future. It is being compared to dog training. I do see some elements of positive reinforcement in her therapy sessions but nothing to harsh. This is obviously very scary. Her therapist does not try to stop her from stimming and is very very patient with her. My daughter actually gets very excited by the idea of spending time with her therapist. I can't shake off what I am reading though. I don't want to damage her future.Can anyone on the spectrum with ABA experience or parents with ASD who go through ABA shed some light here?I thought I was doing the right thing because multiple experts including doctors had suggested ABA. Now I'm having second thoughts.#autism #abatherapy #asd",,8/25/2022,7,254,2,Family Issue,Therapy

I dont feel like i need to be settled instantly or change jobs/location. But every time I call home, i need to produce the same set of reasons for not wanting to get married right fkin now. And sometimes my folks are chill, but lately they are acting more weird and making me feel incompetent at life, as if acting in my best self-interest is somehow wrong for me. And here’s the kicker - they think i should quit my job here in the US soon just so that i get settled and take care of them.I’m completely confused by their expectations by this point. I’ve told them time and again that I’m happy with my career and in no hurry to speed things up. And somehow they think that it’s my duty to become responsible for their life, as if they aren’t healthy enough to take care of themselves (both of them are fit enough to visit the mall several times a month). I got no reason to tell them how to live a life, and it seems insane they would want me to leave my path and join them to do … what? Stay at home and watch tv together for the rest of our life?I see this is a form of emotional manipulation, but the thing that bothers me is that there is no need for it.

I live in a constant state of stress and apprehension and it's hurting my mental health and how I act outside my job. Problem is, there is no hr, we're a startup.

VC & Private Equity Firm,MBAngineer,American Nightmare,"I have been in the US since the fall of 2019 on a student visa, but I swear there hasn't been one single day when I wasn't worried/uncertain about my visa status, one way or another.Finished MBA, got a job, and then started worrying about OPT (work authorization) when it took longer for me than my peers, which led me to think that all the work that I did, didn't mean anything. Kept holding on to my hopes and finally got an approval 2 days before my actual start date in 2021.Started working at a non-profit, and was happy that I wouldn't need to worry about the H-1B lottery. After about 7 months in OPT, I talked with my employer to sponsor me but they said that the company policy was for students to get STEM extension first if they qualified for it - which I did. Applied for it in March 2022, and have been waiting for it since but there is no update. It is widely known that USCIS has been rather faster in processing cases this time around since COVID. All my peers that applied after me have gotten theirs, but not me!Recently, worked my ass off and interviewed for one of the MAGNA companies (all steps done). Currently waiting for a decision, but I have never been this confused/uncertain. Why - you ask? Here is why:1. My work auth. ends in mid-June this year. I don't have a STEM extension yet, and no idea how it is gonna go. Even if I were to get a job at MAGNA, they couldn't sponsor me before April 2023, since they are for-profit and have to go through a lottery process. Therefore, what can I do about such an offer with no STEM extension?2. Waiting for an offer from MAGNA is a big deal for me - as this was my first attempt ever and is something that I can really see myself doing compared to what I currently do. So, yes, waiting sucks!3. Wouldn't it suck if I get an offer from this MAGNA, and can't make a decision because I have no work authorization keeping me in the US to work for it?4. If there is no offer from MAGNA, would I be able to convince my employer to sponsor me H1-B in less than 1.5 months - that exclusively said that I have my STEM first?5. Even if I convince them and get an H1-B, does that mean now I am married to this company whether I like it or not cause that was the only visa/work authorization for me? As I cannot move to a for-profit on a non-profit H1-B.6. Yes, I realize that if my application is in process with the USCIS I get an automatic 6-month extension on my OPT, but it immediately goes away with no opportunity to rectify your application/or re-submit if you get rejected after the expiry of OPT. How can I just take such a big risk by just waiting and hoping for the best?Also, I realize that I am in a better position than many, given where and how I started originally, could never have imagined the life I am living - so yes, I am grateful. But I can't get over the fact that how absurd this rat race for visas/work auths. is.I have everything, and yet nothing. This American dream has been nothing less than an American nightmare. There is so much more that I haven't even touched upon. But, if I could go back in time, I would never choose to come here! However, since I am already here, there is a lot of investment from my side, various expectations (of both myself and my folks), and just leaving all this behind is a sense of failure - which I know I wouldn't be able to cope up with. Maybe I didn't do as well there as I am doing here currently, but I wasn't going bald with the stress that I have at the age of 25.I am not saying that I want everything handed to me on a silver platter. You are more than welcome to have all the regulations you have and decide all the criteria you want, but make it a little less complicated, repetitive, or, essentially, less in-human.And btw, you have to forget about taking any break from all this for mental health.

New,notabot97,PIP and no severance package after 6 years tenure,"I work for a mid tier public company as a senior manager. Got promoted twice, including last year. The current boss who’s Indian (joined 6 months ago) is a bully and provides an environment of no psychological safety and I felt intimidation. He ganged up with another 2 Indians (one reports to me, another his peer whom I work with on a daily basis) and has been bullying me, dismissive of me, and created a very toxic environment for me to work comfortably. He will take words of my 1 direct report and refer it as your team as if 100% of my team. It’s hard to work with direct reports as a team anymore also, because the guy who he ganged with will escalate anything to my boss and blow things out of proportion regardless what I ask. Only reason I mentioned Indian because I’m a non Indian woman and my boss referred me as Indian in many occasions.He started chastising me starting mid feb (performance review cycle is mid March). During perf review he handed me a PIP. I took it with a smile saying let me work on the areas you mentioned not meeting expectations. (My immediate Director position was open for about 2 years after they fired my old boss. One guy joined briefly 6 months ago and left after 2 months). New Director joined a day after I got the PIP, I interviewed the director and have been waiting for him to join so I don’t have to work with the toxic person.He made the environment so toxic in the next 5 days following the PIP that it’s traumatizing at this point. There were slew of emails on a daily basis for months now after office hours, uncomfortable and making me restless. Since the beginning of March, he pushed me to the edge to make my anxiety out of control and I cried after almost every meeting I attended with him because of how intentionally insulting he is. I even tried to move under the Director after his first week, and the boss wouldn’t let that happen. So I talked to the new director about me leaving and tried to negotiate a severance package instead of trying to turn things back with him, because I realized at that point that is impossible, he made up his mind. After 6 years with the company and many late nights and weekends volunteering to work (there were a great many actually, causing personal loss, mental health deterioration) they tell me there is not gonna be any severance package whether I tried to leave early or wait until the end of the PIP.

I miss playing the guitar, each weekend I think I’ll give myself some lone time but wifey and kids take up most of my energy.I know I need to be the provider of the family, is this just a mid life crisis phase? How do you guys cope with this?P.S: Don’t even go by discussing the LC route. I think i’m just too old and tired to grind that now.Edit: Thanks for your responses, I appreciate it.

The only thing I have going on for me now is that I leveled up at work and took up a new role, but that is also starting to feel very overwhelming. I feel like I'm just watching my life deteriorate and I literally feel a weight in me that prevents me from trying to make a change. I know it's the depression and I'm working on it, but I don't see hope. I just live each day like a zombie and put up a smile so that no one can know what's going on.

New,chiefkeefe,Need encouragement 😮‍💨🤠,"Warning: long post2000 ~ 2016:I was a smart kid. E.g. I gave my maths exams early, along with ~30 other kids out of my year of ~200. Extracurriculars were great. Things came easily to me, so my pessimism and laziness didn't affect my outcomes.2016 ~ 2018:At age 16, school got hard. I didn't/couldn't get my shit together, and ended up below the 50th percentile for my year in our end of high school exams.2018: Got accepted to a really good school in Canada (not Waterloo lol) despite mediocre grades (my acceptance letter literally mentioned that they were worried about my grades, but were willing to let me in. Prolly that international student $$$).Paid for sex to get the v card thing off my fucking back (before you shame me - I'm already *deeply* ashamed).Started uni.2018 ~ 2019: 1st year of uni.GPA: 67%. Got a 50% in integral calc lol. Made some friends but withdrew from them in the second half of the year. Never felt like I fitted in anyway. Icing on the cake - I lie to my parents about my grades. They think I'm doing ""just above average"". Lol.Still never had a girlfriend.2019 ~ 2020: 2nd year of uniChose a random major cos my grades were too shit for CS.Spent more time alone. Think hard about killing myself (ideation is a lifelong habit for me, but late 2019 was especially bad). Diagnosed with depression and/or bipolar in Dec 2019. Prescribed seroquel, which I didn't take because a.) I was afraid and b.) I wasn't sure whether or not I had exaggerated my story to the doc.March 2020: End of 2nd yearI fly home cos of COVID and take my exams while living w my parents. GPA (only 2nd year): 58%, including a failed course and 5 (yes, 5) withdrawals on my transcript -- all from 2nd year. Still lying to my parents about my grades. Still never had a girlfriend.I get an audiobook that convinces me to give life a shot. I take a Udemy course on basic Python, and then start learning the MERN stack from another online course.(Aug) 2020 ~ 2021: 3rd year of uniGPA (only 3rd year): 84%. B/c it's easier to attend class/office hours when they're online, plus I took a couple of first year courses to fulfil some requirements, plus I srsly think they made the exams easier. But this is also the first year I actually try (actually go to class and study).I make some progress on the MERN course when I get offered an (unpaid) internship by a (much older) friend of mine. I work with them from Oct 2020 ~ Jan 2021. I slack off on learning web dev until summer 2021.Summer 2021 ~ present:I pick up the MERN course again and work my way through it (~2/3rds done rn). I get a part-time job at a restaurant because my parents are tired of me bleeding them dry. In August, I find an unpaid internship at a startup on Hacker News, and agree to do it part-time alongside school. The startup folds by Oct.I read another self-help book (🙄), build a v basic React Native app based on the ideas in the book, find the author's number online, and cold-call him to pitch the app. He says no (but is very encouraging and gives me lots of advice).I try and fail to start practicing LC regularly. I bomb a couple of interviews.I get a coach to help me deal with the dating problem. After talking for a few weeks, they suggest I may have ADHD. I get seen and diagnosed with ADHD-PI. Currently seeking a second opinion.TODAY:I'm at office hours and see a guy I know who's dating one of my friends. He's a CS major, finishing this December, has had a girlfriend for 2+ yrs @ uni, and is heading off on a post-grad road trip.This guy has enjoyed every single aspect of his uni life. His grades must've been good to get into CS (and finish in < 4 yrs), he's had a great social and dating life, and has a remote job lined up.Every single aspect of my life is dog shit -- even independent of comparison with him. I'm taking extra time to graduate, so I have next summer to find an internship -- but that's looking unlikely (~7 LC done lol). Never dated. Random major, overall GPA: ~73.5%. And no reason to expect things to improve.I'm open to advice, encouragement, roasts, etc. Lol.#mentalhealth #depression #lonely",,11/23/2021,58,1556,6,Family Issue,ADHD
Roku,Soph14,I think my spouse is narcissistic or delustional,"We've been married for 5 years and been fighting or having problems for some time. I'm pretty sure she has some mental issues. She's been diagnosed with anxiety, I think ADD, and used to take medication. She has wild mood swings from being triggered (like from watching TV) and being extremely angry at me to all of a sudden being happy and wanting to cuddle on the couch. She doesn't recognize that it isn't normal behavior. Our fighting is something where she tries to talk over me and not listen to what I have to say. I used to be a very easy going person, tried to think pragmatic, talk things through and all. After being with it, I've turned into yelling at her, being firm in my words.Today, we went out to lunch. She started tearing up about her grandmother getting older and maybe getting Parkinsons. I said that her grandmother is doing well, she knows she loves her, and that they're able to connect, etc. (generallly trying to smooth the situation). Next she lets out how she wants her grandma to see her great-grandkids (we don't have kids... yet). After a bit, she switches the topic into buying a condo or apartment or commercial building for her photography studio. I said that we can look into it. Over the course of the day she obsessed about it and I proceeded to do laundry. She lost it when I wasn't listening. After I did the laundry, I left to go watch football. She texted me asking where her driver's license was, which I didn't know. She thought she lost it.When I got home, she said she didn't find it and that she called the place we were at for lunch and they didn't find it. Then she said she found it in her wallet. Often she does manipulative stuff like that to see if I'll do anything to help her (in the past, of course, if she lost her phone we'd go look for it or her wallet go back and look).Anyways, a bit of a rant. I feel our relationship is falling apart. Going to couples counseling soon.",,11/1/2021,57,2373,15,Family Issue,Anxiety

When time for promotion came, the 2 men on my team were given 3x grade level increases and I wasn’t (I was pregnant that year). I fought hard because I worked the hardest on that project and even my male counterparts agreed. After 2 years they gave me a small bump but also gave my male counterparts a bigger bump.

Cannot concetrate on coding, on the meetings, even when talking to people 1:1, I barely follow the conversation.Talked to my doctor, got another medication prescribed, it doesn't work either.That being said, no surprise, I got ""insufficient results"" few days ago.

Families were proud of us and friends looked at us as ""those who made it"".Then, after about 10 years together, we had our first child and our life literally collapsed. Now, after 3 years of parenthood, we are at a level of misery that is unbearable.Although we unconditionally love our child we both secretly (or not) despair.We don't go out anymore because our kid is impossible to handle. The stress of going out kills our mood to an extent that now we don't want to even try taking the car or going to a restaurant. We are losing touch with our friends. Travelling is out of discussion (did once and it was more stressful than staying home). Sleep is non existent as he still wakes up between 5 and 10 times every single night. No one of us is fit anymore, as we barely have time for a shower. Passion is gone (no one of us has any interest and energy to even talk about sex).Due to covid we didn't get any help from nannies and our families. Only kindergarten.Plus, we always valued our privacy and personal spaces, so having people at home (nanny, helpers) was always a big no.But we are now a breaking point.My only solace is watching some TV (we have 20-40 minutes free every couple of days) and randomly look at pictures of few years ago, when we had a life.

I achieved her dream of me working at Google and I feel so weak for not being able to overcome mental health issues. I've climbed to ""the top"" relatively quickly and now feel unmotivated and trapped and unfulfilled. This thought that I will have to feel this way for 40 more years of work is incredibly burdensome.The only time I feel okay is when I'm out at nature. I often have the thought that maybe I should leave tech and pursue a field that seems less stressful though I know comp would be non existent (hiking guide, artist, etc). The grass is always greener on the other side I realize so would love to know if anyone has left tech to pursue their ""passions"" or something more fulfilling for less money and how you feel about it/ what your experience has been /any tips...Thanks#depression #burnout #mentalhealth",,1/5/2022,33,1237,16,Family Issue,Stress

My success in the corporate world is tied to my actions that are in the best interest of the ""company"".It maybe shocking that this is not something that ever crossed my mind before(maybe idealism or naive optimism), that it is the inevitable, and one of the many intentional design of the capitalistic system/society.

I would rather pick integrity and basic human ethics than to be ambitious and successful.

If I am planning a trip or house hunting, I am able to make all of the decisions that I need to make in an optimal way, and quickly. I.e. least money spent, the best product selected, etc.3. If I am leet coding. I am actually able to solve a ton of questions with precision. I am able to get 90%+ in both speed and memory, I am able to get my solutions accepted with the least amount of failures and retries.4. If I am working on my office-related work. I am able to do all of my codings, and testing and get to code reviews where people just accept my changes with a minimal amount of comments.And usually, the things that I build during my peak mental performance are usually stable. They are almost bug-free.5.

Verizon,desiphnx,30 Indian Male in US-started anti depressants 3 months back and feeling a lot better now. AMA,"Hey, I am a 30ish Indian male. I was really depressed and anxious from Nov 2020-May, 2021. Had to visit emergency in Feb 2021 misinterpreting an anxiety attack as heart attack, when I started feeling tingling on my left hand and leg. I was prescribed lexapro 5mg by my GP after the ER visit, when he diagnosed me with mild to severe anxiety and depression.I took the med for 2 days but I felt slight burning sensation under my feet, a weird feeling in my head, and I felt as if I am hearing sounds. This scared me, as I assumed that my gp just gave me the generic stuff which might not be catering to my needs. So I stopped after 2 days.I didn’t start until May because of inhibitions about meds. I eventually went to a psychiatrist (luckily an old indian lady) and got on 5 mg lexapro and then 100 mg sr Wellbutrin at my 4 week later visit. This time I sticked to the plan.With Lexapro the side affects were similar as earlier, very mild headache for a couple of days, and random dreams for a couple of weeks, and lack of focus and lethargy. But my morning anxiety was in controlI started Wellbutrin to stay alert and focused. It elevated my anxiety for a almost a week, but I didn’t give up this time.I am in a much much better place now. I am planning to discuss tapering down my dosage on my next visit to the psychiatrist.▪️I am back at physical activities (running, workout)▪️No brain fog anymore▪️No more suicidal thoughts▪️No self pity▪️no lack of motivation▪️No panic attacks▪️No bouts of uncontrollable crying▪️Much better grip over my confidence and thinking on feetCons:I am restless (in a good way), and I see an openness and boldness in my behavior which at times becomes taking more risks, spending generously (for family, not on useless stuff), and seeking for adventure (which seems a bit unnecessary at times)If you have any questions regarding my experience , please let me know. If this can help one person to get better, this post will serve it’s purpose.Update 1- I have recently started seeing a counselor (had 2 sessions in last 3 weeks). I didn’t feel the need to do counseling but wanted to try it for self improvement and coaching. He’s an american guy who moved out of corporate out of burnout, went to grad school, got his license and started the practice. His background helps him to understand my position. We just chitchat and have a good 1 hour conversation about life, purpose and cultures in general. I am enjoying this so will continue, might reduce the frequency from once in a couple of weeks to 1 monthly later on. My purpose out of these sessions is to achieve the right balance between the emotional peaks and valleys that I experience and reach a baseline.Update 2: Saw my psychiatrist today. It was a very pleasant conversation. I explained her the improvement in my mental and physical health. We decided to alternate the meds each day (lexapro and wellbutrin). She even said if I feel stopping them then I can. I am starting to taper down the meds, though the prescription will be for 30 pills a month to keep enough stock if needed.I also told her about this post and told her how mental health is a grave issue in our tech community as well, which she was already aware of. She told me she should would love to help as many as possible, below are the details of the provider I use to take the appointments:https://www.cenclear.orgDr. Sreedevi KomarneniUpdate 3: I forgot to mention earlier but in my first visit, the diagnosis she did was adjustment anxiety, as I was dealing with new place, new job role, new community, and that was causing me stress and lowered confidence.

I've interviewed with over 150+ companies in last 6 months and yet I'm failing to get a company of my choice! I just don't know what to do, I just am so down in my life and I've started to hate to even interview!And talk about other struggle, Covid ruined my Master's as being an international student isn't easy so I couldn't get a chance to make friends!

She’s beautiful and I’ve had a crush on her all throughout college. She is a business major and I’m in Computer Science. She doesn’t do shit with her $54k job. Just a few phone calls and meetings per day. Max 10 hours of work per week. She has a lot of free time in her hands.Whereas, I’m in a very stressful job. Honestly, I love my job. I’m learning a lot everyday and I don’t mind the long work hours in my mid-20s. My girlfriend doesn’t understand how stressful my job is and just complains and throws fits that I’m unable to spend time with her. I don’t have time for friends, Netflix, or any of my old hobbies. I do love to work out everyday for an hour, but she’s demanding that limited hour I have for the gym to be spent with her. I have absolutely no peaceful alone time to myself. In college, we used to spend hours and hours together because we were both carefree and had ample time. My life changed post college and hers didn’t.On top, I like to say I’m a pretty dedicated guy. I do courses on Udemy to get better at my SDE skills for a couple of hours on the weekend (max 3-5 hours). She makes me feel guilty when I try to work on myself Bc that’s less attention towards her. It frustrates me that she doesn’t work on career and just watches Netflix or hangs with friends all the time. She puts no time to get better at her career and make her way into a better job.I’m the one that pays for every single date ($500+ per month) since she can’t afford paying with her salary. Why doesn’t she work on getting better at her skillset instead of focusing on all the friend drama and demanding constant attention from me?Am I overthinking this?

Now that i spoke with her I found out that there have been some issues between her and my friends mother to an extent that their arguments became violent. And now that I helped his wife, my friend is blaming me that I have an affair with his wife - I really don’t, she is like my sister and she called me literally begging to help so I had to go. I went to their wedding and he knows he is lying but his mother has his brain messed up and clearly feeding him wrong ideas.The wife is safe now but I am devestated. What can I do to help?

Amazon,mEXI76,Should I try Adderall if I’m already doing well? (Sr Engineer @ AMZN),"When I was growing up my parents thought I had ADHD and Autism, took me regularly to some sort of “center” where they’d spin me around, have me take all sorts of tests, and watch Nintendo game footage while hooked up to an EEG (it’d speed up to normal speeds if certain brainwaves were detected, to this day I still have no idea wtf it was), I’m estranged now and don’t know much of the details so I’d have to get re-assessed as an adult. I’d get coffee to focus in elementary school, ended up getting kicked out of multiple private schools for attention issues/poor performance. Luckily hyper-focus, creativity, & disposition to lateral thinking (for better or worse lol) have all helped me do very well for myself as a Software Engineer.Over the last year I’ve overhauled my life and have increased my overall effectiveness as a person by establishing:- Consistent sleep schedule- Daily exercise, stretch, & jog- Meditation, regular reading- Consistent routine whiteboard for every task I do at every time (vitamins, start work, dinner, jog, etc)- Weekly retro & planning with my wife, like scrum but more sweetness- Uninstall any app I develop subconscious reflexes to open while working to provide stimulation (usually while compiling or during context switching)- No nicotine (even though it helped with focus)All of these have been incredibly effective, but I still need to always take notes while having work conversions otherwise my mind wanders, I don’t notice details of my physical surroundings unless I explicitly try to notice because thinking/imagining is very immersive. And I struggle doing mundane tasks (dishes, cleaning, cooking) without listening to audiobooks/podcasts. My messaging SLA with friends is around 1 week until I forget, so I mostly try to stick to synchronous communication. Sleeping is impossible without something interesting enough to focus on, otherwise my mind synthesizes an infinite cacophony of random things to think about.So anyways, I’m thinking about getting evaluated and trying Adderall, but I don’t take the decision lightly & wanted to get some perspectives before going further.TC: 400kYOE: 6 (26yo bootcamp grad)#ADHD #careerUpdate: sounds like the consensus is a definitive no, thanks everyone! 🙏",400000,3/27/2022,19,720,7,Family Issue,Autism

I have never hear of racism before and I still don’t understand why someone will think other people are inferior to them.I don’t know anything about the politics of US, please don’t make this political.Maybe the society I grew up in was very naïve that we tend to treat foreigners better than natives and never had conversations on racism. With everything going on, am so overwhelmed and it is seriously affecting my mental health and the quality of my life.It was hard making friends before, now it even much harder. I can’t even have conversations with people, all I can think of now is racism and it driving me crazy. I have experienced a bit of people being assholes towards me like store keepers tailing me when shopping, random people calling me n***(to be honest, I didn’t know this was racist) and a cop following me to my apartment one time( I thought he was being friendly so I said hi and thanked him when I got to my apartment). I am very naïve and I like that, it makes me see good in everything however, I am double guessing peoples' intentions and I just want everything to stop.I have tried dressing better and more professional and staying from everything going on. Even when am walking towards people, I try to give them plenty of space ( I have experienced couple of people moving to the other walkway on the other side of the road because they were walking toward me), so I started to give them lot of space/assurance that I am minding my own business.I have tried watching videos on how other people handled moving to a new continent and everything going on but they are helping. YouTube is the worst, it continuously recommends videos about racism. I have uninstalled several apps from my phone including YouTube because of this.I just want to live a simple life, have few great friends and start a family and mind my own business and help other people whenever I can.Any advice on how to not go crazy in North America and just live a great life? #racism #advisory #depression #mentalhealth",,6/20/2021,93,4072,16,Family Issue,Mental Health

Facebook,gnwia,Roommate inviting people over without consent,"Update: to people why I got a roommate - surprisingly, I had a good experience with my previous roommates. Ex-roommate who I lived together for 3 years until I moved to the new city, she only brought a friend occasionally and they would stay quietly in their room and leave early. Her friend would never sleep over. Funnily enough I didn’t even need to ask anything because she took all precautions about covid (making sure her guest is vaccinated) and privacy. She also always asked me at least a day before when she invited a friend (and I never said no). We never had any issue over guests, noise or paying the bills. She and I were compatible and I was hoping a living environment like this. The roommate before her didn’t enjoy bringing guests home either so it was fine. I guess I was just super lucky. One bedroom in this city is $3500+. My monthly income is nowhere 3x than that. Why are people all so mad? In the end my roommate had her friend over, I didn’t say any single word and instead posted here first, because if I have to move out, I will. I’m not kicking her out. Is it a sin to have a social anxiety? Should all socially anxious people just totally isolate themselves from the society because we’re weird and don’t function as normal people? I don’t know think you’re normal either if you choose to spend your time bullying a mentally struggling person when you can do million better things on the internet. Fyi I posted this in the “Mental Health” forum.I’ve had social anxiety for years and am proactively taking medication and getting therapies. However I find it very uncomfortable when a stranger enters my apartment. I just moved to a new city and when getting a roommate, I made this explicit. My roommate moved in knowing this and agreed not to have guests over.She however had her sister over for the entire first month when she moved in because she needed some help. This made me uncomfortable so I told her about it but she was mad at me trying to have this talk because she’s paying for the rent and she has the right to do whatever she wants to do. So I let her sister stay for the whole month.Last night was Sunday night and I was sick in bed. And I have work on Monday. Apparently she sent me a text at 8pm Sunday if she can have her friend over (my roommate is a student). I was sleeping so I didn’t read it. Today, monday morning, I woke up and this stranger that I don’t know if fully vaccinated is in my living room with my roommate. She invited her knowing my social anxiety and not having consent from me. I was still nice and said hello and had a small talk with her friend but explained to them I had work because it’s Monday (I work from home). I asked her friend if she’s staying and she said she’s leaving. The apartment has very bad soundproofing and I had meetings but her friend stayed and they hung out really loudly. It’s been 17 hours and her friend is still here.I locked myself in my room now but I feel my roommate was so rude and disrespectful that she pretended she agreed with me and is not sticking to her own words. There were other occasions where she had loud phone calls on speakers (never wear headphones) in communal areas when I had meetings. Whenever I try to talk nicely about things she gets frustrated because “she doesn’t want other people to tell her what to do.”I’m trying not to be an asshole but that’s why I was upfront and transparent about the social anxiety thing I have with the guests and looked for someone who was okay with this. Her behavior is making me super anxious, nervous, and very hard to focus on work. Once the anxiety is triggered I can never relax and I feel unsafe.

Been working out west during covid; loved the lifestyle and access to nature. With RTO/hybrid coming up, we need to move back to NYC and the thought makes me depressed (not enough accessible outdoor activities). While NYC is fun, it's not where we want to end up, and every year spent there is a year we don't get to live the life we want.Sadly, I doubt we can personally make even close our current tc outside of NY. Definitely going to stay in NYC until end of year, but still debating whether to move or stay past that point. Maybe can stay a few years and try going 100% remote after we're senior enough.Should we grind it out a few more years, or just move out west now?

Microsoft,90oilnk,Very disturbed lately. Now getting ads about therapy.,"Lately I have been extremely disturbed mentally. Family being the main reason behind the mental stress. Over the weekend, I just took a drive out and had a break down of sorts. Shouted out, cried out loudly my grief for well over 15-20 minutes, all alone in the car. Literally nobody else knows what I am going through. Interesting part starts next.Surprisingly, ever since that day, like even before I even reached home, I'm suddenly getting therapy related ads all over the internet, Spotify, YouTube mainly, then on chrome and other websites. Hulu also started showing those ads later in the evening. Most surprising was even my employer's benefits team sent out a generic email about tie ups with organizations that provide therapy.Now, the employer email might be a coincidence, but the ads everywhere, are they also a coincidence?? I find it hard to believe so. Is this yet another proof that these big companies know what we're going through and are listening to us all the time?Not that I really care even if they are listening, but this seems a little too much to call it a simple coincidence.what do you think?TC:192k#mentalhealth #depression",192000,5/4/2022,16,426,1,Family Issue,Stress

Just complete the paperwork and update manager when approvals come through etc. her medical and psych doctors have recommended the same.What is better for long term strategy and to minimize the risk of termination ?

I notice logical connections I never did before. I also come up with some great ideas in large quantity. I wonder if it's kind of like letting the floodgates of your mind fully open (since I might have a lot of mental filters).Also, the author of One Piece said he gets his best ideas and does the best work when he's at 2 hours of sleep (although he averages 4 hours per night anyway).So how about you? What is your experience with amount of sleep and quality/quantity of work or other results you've noticed?Obviously you're going to fuck up your body if you do this too consistently but I'm theorizing that low sleep could be used as a technique once in a while.#sleepEdit: Added a poll as requested but I'd still love to hear your thoughts and anecdotes below.",,1/20/2022,32,735,2,Others,Others

New,ieYX88,Handling expenses with spouse,"Recently, we bought a fixer upper home in an HCOL in US. My husbands parents from India contributed a substantial amount as a help in the home remodelling.I am truly thankful to this gesture, but my husband keeps on bringing it whenever we have an argument. Sometimes, when things get pretty bad, he points out how my parents have made bad investment choices, and that they cant even afford to help us anytime. He also pinpoints how my parents preferred to travel and spend on leisure activities instead of saving up for secondary home investments.For me, i always think, it was their personal choice. They paid for my masters and think of me as an independent individual now. Nor do they ask me for any money. But its a lifestyle choice where i feel its completely their choice to spend their money howsoeverMy husbands parents have been pretty much saving up their entire lives, and only thought about money and how they could buy multiple houses from their savings without really enjoying their lives.He brings this point everytime to demean how my parents did not think like this way.I appreciate what his parents have done, but its not like i was asking for that money.I even said to my husband, i am fine without the home improvements until we save something ourselves.I am finding it hard to balance and have a solution to this problem.I dont want to live as if i am using them, or also keep on listening to how my parents made wrong choices.I just want to save money as per my pace, and live accordingly within limits. However, my husband always brings up this point, and it pisses me off. My in laws are also insisting to take more money, and they feel I am the one who is rejecting it, but why should their son compromise?Its really affecting my mental health.

Meta,prider,Looking for advise from seasoned Managers,"HiI became a Manager not a very long time ago. I have quite a high performing team with considerable output. There are some holes which I'm working on plugging.However,I go from having 10 meetings in a day or even 60 hours work week to 2 meetings a day and a very light week. I feel like there is no balance in how many hours I work in a day or week. I'm a workaholic so it feels unnatural during lighter days.Am I doing something wrong? I meet with plenty of stakeholders and constantly remove hurdles for the team without a miss. Team loves working with me. Pulse scores are in the sky. If I met with even more people, I may end up either absorbing more work for the team or pivot the team too much from their focus.Seasoned Mangers, how have you managed your schedules and what do you recommend to a newb? Am I getting too anxious over nothing or am I missing something? What more can I do?",,8/22/2022,5,196,2,Toxic Manager,Anxiety

This has annoyed her and she has been causing issues where there is constant emotional abuse. She has also threatened to keep from visiting my daughter. I have been fighting and so far it has been manageable but sometimes I think if I take myself out of the equation things may cool down.

Lyft,sushisnack,You know what's awesome? Adderall.,"Not for everyone. But for me it is. And it's clear I'm exactly who it was intended for.About a month ago through a series of events I realized I might actually have ADHD. I was very skeptical, and did not want to get on a stimulant by lying. I saw a doctor. I answered everything as honestly as I possibly could. He said I'm square in the middle of the profile of someone with ADHD. I was still skeptical. He said he'd be comfortable prescribing Adderall.I didn't know if I wanted to take it, but after thinking through how impossible it felt to get through individual meetings without giving all my energy, let alone day after day of so many meetings, and how I forget to bring things (phone, wallet, kids - jk) whenever I leave a place, or how I needed to dedicate so much extra time to make sure I remembered all my tasks, complete with reminder after reminder built into my self-management system, or how my inattention affected conversations with my wife, I decided to give it a go.My understanding is if someone does not have ADHD they will feel a high, followed by a low, might get a burst of energy to get things done, but it doesn't really ""fix"" anything. If someone does have ADHD the dopamine levels are better regulated and the energy it takes to focus goes to normal. They're not all of a sudden smarter, but they can put that energy to where they'd actually like to use it. Greatly decreased fidgety behaviors. Impulse control goes to normal, etc.Here I am a month later. Is this seriously how ""everyone else"" feels ALL THE TIME? I can get through a day packed full of meetings, and feel somewhat tired from it, but not like I am beat and can't do anything for the rest of the day. I've stopped biting my fingernails. I've stopped the nervous tic of running my fingers through my hair through entire meetings. I remember my things when I leave a place. I have much better conversations with my wife and understand her better. I always met deadlines, but now I meet deadlines days before the due date instead of right at the due date almost every single time.What I would like to say is if you have a mental issue, see a doctor. Get medication. If that doesn't help, get the medication or dosage changed until it works. See a therapist who specializes in what you're going through. And it is often so simple and easy to get it.",,9/8/2021,51,1890,24,Therapist Issue,ADHD

Overtime the toxic culture started to stink.I have no friends at Amazon, anyone I like working with moves to a different team or firm, people are constantly trying to deliver/earn more/stay away from PIP, there is a lot of work, there is no non-work topics or engagement at all in my 1 year so far, team events are also badly organized, employees leaving don't even get a decent farewell (we send lazy miss you, good luck cards), etc.As I look back, some mistakes I made were:- over working myself- constantly scared of PIP though I am a good/great performer (confirmed by peers, manager, etc.)- Not going out for sports (I've never been a sports guy, now I wish I should've done it to build a community/engagement outside of work)- didn't goto the gym/stay active (put on 20+ lbs in 2020, 2021 and 2022 so far. Now I am less confident of my attire given the flab for any social gathering)- Didn't actively try to get my wife a social setting to engage herself in at the new location. With the kid life has been busy, I supported her as much as I could and parents were here on n off. But we didn't have friends in the new location, old friends are amazing but having someone close we could meet every week would have been a life changer.- Missed my family extremely during the pandemic, I realized that I make good $s now (after I joined Amazon), it's a blessing in disguise to move back home. My India pay is going to be very comfortable when I go back.Here's what I am doing:- Looking internally to a switch to a team in Seattle/SFO which has significant presence in India and a solid roadmap. I am in conversations right now. I will move here and wait till new comp kicks in 2023 to carry my RSU n move to India.- my wife n kid will visit India for a month, she feels lonely here and I think it would be better for them to fly home for a bit. I will join them for a short duration and come back together.- I will hit the gym starting this week.- I am going to an Indian movie this week with a few folks from an Indian slack group at work. Maybe I can relate to them and have a few friends.- I will pick a sport in the next few weeks and weather is improving so it will get better.- Constantly thinking of opportunities for my wife to engage here (we are also considering her moving for good to India in 2nd half of 2022 with our kid and finding a job there. She quit her job in India when we got married, long story. I will stay away from them for 3-4 months and then return for good. Parents and our support system in India is great. They'd love to have her n my kid back.)TC: 280-300, YOE: 8",280000,3/25/2022,15,625,8,Indians Issue,Others
LinkedIn,dayz,Destigmatize PIP,"We are at this point in our careers that the fear of PIP is eating us away. So many of us, have been great performers academically and even at work but sometimes we are not able to do justice to the work requirements. We may overcommit to avoid getting labeled as lazy or B player and not be able to finish on time. That's OKAY. that's life... Sometimes we thrive...other times we just try to stay afloat... Just because someone else is working on weekends and late nights doesn't mean you have to... Under the crushing fear of being stack ranked and getting pipped we just have forgotten to live our lives. We are getting old by every passing minute... Don't tell me that you are not... You know you are... Don't let this greed/chasing TC eat up your soul... Many of us became software engineers just for the thrill of problem solving... We don't have to carry that weight on our minds when we logoff from work.. there's no need to feel guilty or anxious about it. Tomorrow you get back with more energy and take that challenge head on but it's okay if you can't do that today.P.S. I've read so many PIP stories on Blind so I had to say this..

UNiDAYS,PythonAce,I know you guys all love negativity...but...,"Hey - I'm an HR guy, worked for Tech companies and consulted 2 of FAANG on workforce planning.For anyone job searching - this has literally been one of the worst years ever. The complete oversaturation of the job market with a complete cliff of open roles has left people job less, seeking, interviewing and competing for more roles than in recorded history.That got worse when the 2020 grads entered the job pool and 83% lost their offers.Right now the average rate of candidate per position is about 4.8x the usual and in 2018 and 2019, this was already starting to get very high with the functionality of ATS increasing and more and more people taking alternate routes into Corporate positions.I see it all the time on LinkedIn and in discord servers. One of the worst feelings is endless job searching that doesn't go anywhere. Both polars are terrible. Never getting any hits back can put you in a silent depression and going through the non stop recruiiting, zoom calls, here's 6 more people you have to meet with, just to get the ""while everyone enjoyed meeting you..."" email is like a roller coaster of torturous emotions.If this is you for this year - you are likely feeling really bad. Especially as junior SWE jackasses complain about how they REALLY wanted 10,000 more from their Google offer before they can think about accepting their Facebook offer.Do not let this define you. Do not let yourself think you are less valuable. Do not give into the cycle of depression. All of this will pass. The job market will increase and uptick, new roles will come into being and 2020 will start to fade. Hang in there. Do not ever let yourself feel less valuable, or unworthy. There is literally more applicants per position than hiring managers even know what to do with, and idiots like Nick Singh creating ""MassApply"" and Wonsulting morons encouraging students to mass email and mass cold message hiring managers means they aren't even opening emails right now.Just make sure you take care of yourself, take care of your mind and body and don't simmer in the negativity. It's not you.#depression #mentalhealth #jobsearch#candidaterejection",,10/21/2020,39,7646,232,Toxic Manager,Mental Health
DECATHLON FRANCE,Tsub37,Offer my help for ADHD developers,"I'm an MLE, who's seriously thinking about moving forward as an ADHD coach. I only have 5 clients at this moment, but I can see the smile on their faces. They told me they've got much confidence since working with me. I'm so happy and I've never had the same feeling as a software developer. I'm also thinking about doing another Ph.D. in psychology and started applying (I already have one in engineering).Being a developer with ADHD is really hard. We blame ourselves for tiny small mistakes and worry if our performances are good or not. And because of our executive function deficit and perfectionism, sometimes the work can seriously burn us out. If you think I might be able to help you, just message me, I will offer a one-hour free coaching session to you.I'm also trilingual, so I also offer my coaching in French and Mandarin.#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #adhd",,9/28/2021,47,924,19,Family Issue,Burnout
Amazon,cyrril,I'm just so sad/lonely.,"I graduated 3 years ago from undergrad (I'm 24) and life has been really miserable ever since.I'm not capable of maintaining a connection with anyone. You're supposed to meet life long friends in college, and I graduated with a degree. Everyone else in my ""friend group"", had a significant other or best friend or something else to show of their time there. Me? I've never been in a relationship. Whenever something good or bad happens, I have no one to tell.I try to reach out to people I was ""friends"" with in college, but after exchanging pleasantries, I'm ghosted. Either left on read, or left forever on unread. Over the last 3 months, it's happened with 13 people and it hurts. It's painfully obvious I don't exist to them and I feel worthless. For example, on my birthday a couple months ago, only one of these 13 wished me. I wished every single of them on theirs.Am I inherently unlikable? To an extent, I now know the people I associate with in college were toxic. How do I make friends as an adult? Especially during covid.I don't want to give up and accept a life of misery just yet, but what can I do?TC: 240k",240000,10/22/2020,157,10900,113,Others,Others

Have searched Blind for any related posts but couldn’t find any.Update: thanks for the fast and almost overwhelming responses.Many have asked whether I asked her what’s wrong or tell me why.

Although, there are people in my team who are still working from different locations/countries/time zones - He is forcing me to move back to the city that I was hired for, stating the reason that it is good to have in-person discussions in the team.

I always wanted to move to the bay and I really didn’t like to be around my parents so I moved to the bay to reset my life and find a new job and make new friends. I ended up finding a job that almost double my TC (230k+70k signon), but In return I lose my team and it’s not full remote, I thought I was fine with that. I have lots of college debt (70k), younger sisters that I want to support for college, and I’m my parents retirement plan so the money would help a lot.Yesterday I learned my grandma was diagnosed with multiple myeloma cancer, and all I could think was I’m so far away from her. I called her and she said everything is okay but she’s really weak. Everyone in my family does not want to take care of her and said she’s better off sitting in bed just like our grandpa because she’s old. Even with treatment her survival rate at her age is low and I don’t know how long she has as the 1,5,10 year survival rate is 80,50,30 and no one in the family has time to bring her to treatment (except my one sister now).My grandma primarily raised me and she would always call to ask when I would come over, but now I’m feeling guilty being so far away. She tells me not to worry. I’m flying back this week just to see her but I realize I don’t want to be around her after a plane ride because I might catch something.Before I left to the bay I hung out with her, took pictures with her because I know anything in life can happen so I wanted to just spend more time just in case but now that this has happened I feel so… I’m just not happy, idk. And with my new company being hybrid I don’t think I can visit home often for long periods.My logical side says I could just call her, and if anything happens I’m sure the company will let me go home. Since there’s no exact timeline of what will happen, if anything, I can’t worry about it all the time. Life happens so I need to just hope for the best. But today my logical side isn’t comforting.I took off this week despite already submitting my notice for my company, I just hope my next company (Zoox) will be flexible if anything happens.I just wanted to vent, thank you for listening blind.

I always wanted to move to the bay and I really didn’t like to be around my parents so I moved to the bay to reset my life and find a new job and make new friends. I ended up finding a job that almost double my TC (230k+70k signon), but In return I lose my team and it’s not full remote, I thought I was fine with that. I have lots of college debt (70k), younger sisters that I want to support for college, and I’m my parents retirement plan so the money would help a lot.Yesterday I learned my grandma was diagnosed with multiple myeloma cancer, and all I could think was I’m so far away from her. I called her and she said everything is okay but she’s really weak. Everyone in my family does not want to take care of her and said she’s better off sitting in bed just like our grandpa because she’s old. Even with treatment her survival rate at her age is low and I don’t know how long she has as the 1,5,10 year survival rate is 80,50,30 and no one in the family has time to bring her to treatment (except my one sister now).My grandma primarily raised me and she would always call to ask when I would come over, but now I’m feeling guilty being so far away. She tells me not to worry. I’m flying back this week just to see her but I realize I don’t want to be around her after a plane ride because I might catch something.Before I left to the bay I hung out with her, took pictures with her because I know anything in life can happen so I wanted to just spend more time just in case but now that this has happened I feel so… I’m just not happy, idk. And with my new company being hybrid I don’t think I can visit home often for long periods.My logical side says I could just call her, and if anything happens I’m sure the company will let me go home. Since there’s no exact timeline of what will happen, if anything, I can’t worry about it all the time. Life happens so I need to just hope for the best. But today my logical side isn’t comforting.I took off this week despite already submitting my notice for my company, I just hope my next company (Zoox) will be flexible if anything happens.I just wanted to vent, thank you for listening blind. I know TC isn’t everything but I feel so constrained(?).Old TC: 140kNew TC: 230k (+70k signon)YoE: 3#mentalhealth #family",140000,3/29/2022,16,727,6,Family Issue,Mental Health
Thermo Fisher,dre34,Stress - going back to office,"Hi,My current manager is giving me so much stress that, it has come to a point that I am not able to concentrate on work. Even a notification of a new email from him adds to it and gives a mini panic attack. I'll give a background to the situation:I was initially working from a different work location and moved back home due to covid and changed family dynamics. Everything was fine until my manager decided to make 3+ days in the office mandatory for everyone. Although, there are people in my team who are still working from different locations/countries/time zones - He is forcing me to move back to the city that I was hired for, stating the reason that it is good to have in-person discussions in the team. I find this insane as there are people in the team who continue to work from different office locations (and even time zones)- the meetings are still online to accommodate 'those' people.There's a lot more to this but does it sound unreasonable to anyone? #mentalhealth",,5/13/2022,12,603,4,Family Issue,Stress

Amazon,PurpleRa1n,Is my marriage over?,"I am always fighting about money with him. We started to build a house. His business failed a few years ago and put us in huge debt. So he has spent his time building the house going on 5 years now. I am the only one working and we have a family so I am constantly telling him to budget stuff out. But he claims if he doesn’t spend money he cannot buy what he needs to finish building the house. So all I work for goes to pay his failed business debt, materials so he can finish building the house and taking care of the family. I feel like I’ve had enough. I can’t live and work forever to pay debt. He throws it back on me that if I want the house done, then he needs to buy stuff to build. I throw it back on him that if he wants the house built, go get a part time job to pay his own debt off. I tell him I work so hard and have nothing to show for except a partially done house and debt.I guess he thinks he cannot work in order to finish building the house. However I feel I cannot keep living paycheck to paycheck as he keeps using this reason. I can’t afford his debt and house construction on top of other normal finances.He gets angry when I say this because now I’m insulting him for all the hard work he put into building the house. He reverts to calling me nasty names and says all I think about is myself.The thought of divorce feels like the right thing but at the same time will that drain me even more financially.

Amazon,wawY45,"Lack of interest in work, but get better sleep and appetite now, do I qualify for depression and extension of my leave?","I'm at a point in my Anxiety and Depression where I'm no longer having issues with sleep and appetite like at the start when I was still at work. Reason being that the stressor has been removed -- I no longer have to report to work due to the leave.But I'm still indifferent to work (any work), haven't started LeetCode, haven't replied to incoming recruiter's emails, haven't applied to any jobs, haven't done anything other than help other people with their own issues at Amazon here on Blind. I used to be excited about software and engineering, and about interviews, too, but now I feel mostly indifferent.I was having major issues with sleep and appetite during PIP and before the leave was approved.Now for the extension, my therapist is letting me down in implying that since I met a friend for the first time in 2 years of the lockdown, and that I sleep and eat mostly okay now, that I'm already ready to go back to work, whereas I know that I'm not ready just yet.It was very difficult to find a therapist willing to do FMLA paperwork in the first place, and I'm so disappointed by this betrayal that I'm not in the mood to restart the whole search all over again.Do I just go back to be fired shortly after the return (probably 50% of my Pivot and the appeals succeeding), or do I find another therapist willing to sign off an extension in the leave?Do you have to have major sleep/appetite/etc issues throughout the Anxiety/Depression mental health leave to be eligible for continuation and extension? Are you no longer eligible if you ""simply"" can't make yourself turn the laptop and put on the face, and need more time to get to deal with the Apathy and indifference caused by the underlying Anxiety and Depression?

Google,peace ✌️,Why you are so unhappy despite a high TC (and what to do about it)?,"TLDR: a very long post that tries to explain human psychology behind why people are unhappy despite getting great compensation.I am writing this post as I see so many people here extremely unhappy despite making exceptionally high TCs for their age (including myself).My motivation for this post is my own reflections that revealed that even though my net worth increased ~10 times in last few years since I joined Google, overall I started to feel that I care more about money and react more negatively when I lost money or made a wrong buying decision. Moreover, I saw similar behaviors in many of my friends many of whom surprisingly were earlier very chilled out and carefree about spending money.As an avid learner and applicator of psychology, I did a lot of introspection and reflection to understand the root causes of this phenomenon. I describe them as follows:1. High TC implies very low marginal utility of money ( for me it’s 0):Imagine if someone gave you the equivalent of 2-3 month current salary when you were 16-18. How much fun could you have with that money in that age? When I first got my job, I bought a lot of things I really wanted like video games, gadgets and my own furniture. However, at this point, the addition of new paycheck simply doesn’t mean there is anything new I can buy. Whatever I want to buy, I can already buy. So, essentially marginal utility of money = 0 for me.I don’t mean to say that it’s better to have hand to mouth existence, but for most of us new paycheck doesn’t bring any new happiness or new capabilities except for increasing our bank numbers by a small percentage.2. With high TC, Career is a class struggle:Based on cause no. 1, I tried to ask myself this question about what will I do If I had tonnes of money, let’s say like 500 million dollars.You should ask this question to yourself before reading further. For me, my options were buying a big home with a nice view, having a full time personal chef, a home gym, a high quality personal trainer 3 times a week, good health care and spending lots of time with friends and family. And in addition, the freedom to work on projects that I really wanted to work on.If you categorize this, it’s mainly a few categories: home, health, time, family and freedom.Now here is the interesting part: to increase your TC marginally through promotion or higher bonus, you actually have to sacrifice all of these things 🤷‍♂️ you will have more work hours, less energy, poorer health and less family time.So, essentially what most people want from their careers is to be able to live the lifestyle of the next class, but tools at their disposal actually take them further away from the elements of the lifestyle of next class. And not everyone will make it to the next class unfortunately. These classes exist for a reason. Upward mobility is not so easy. That’s why so many people get stuck in their careers.So most of us are stuck in a very stable but unhappy equilibrium (or local minima of TC so to speak) where in either direction you don’t get extra happiness. Now some people can push through to make it to the next class, but not everyone will get there. Hence the quiet desperation 🤷‍♂️3. Leadership/growth vs. stress trade off:For most people, going up in career means higher stress at least for a while until they become VP equivalent or something.On the other hand, not going up in career means your peers will become your bosses which again means poor mental health as humans are inherently competitive ( and high achievers even more so).So essentially, another stable but unhappy equilibrium.4. Replaceability of labor in large corporate environments and lack of purpose:Given that the corporate systems such as FAANG are so giant, the value that each individual brings is far too low proportional to the entire system. This leads to a dynamic characterized by very high replaceability. But in general, humans don’t like to be considered replaceable. And, in fact humans are not indeed replaceable in most important relationships they have. Also such high degrees of replaceablity takes away any reasonable sense of purpose for doing our job for most people.Our real relationships such as parents, siblings, kids, partners are actually slot relationships and most of them can’t be refilled, at least not very easily.So in short, work relationships in big corporations are a very unnatural form of human relationships.5. Breadwinner anxiety:This is more true for guys ( I am a guy) but many women also feel it. It’s the constant anxiety of ensuring complete financial safety of your family. This is even worsened in the field of technology as its a relatively new and fast moving field and it’s not very clear how your career will progress and if you could become obsolete.This is usually not the case in fields like medicine. Technology can change and be automated but people will not. They will still keep getting sick 🤷‍♂️I believe, this is one of the reasons FIRE, and fatFIRE are becoming so popular in the tech community. I think it’s a response to unclear career progression for most people.Now some additional smaller reasons:6. Coding is a very unnatural form of intelligence task:Coding is not the same as working on an excel sheet. Because when you code it’s far more interactive and unpredictable than using a standard software. This affects your brain pathways as our brains are not designed to interact intelligently with such complex systems which are not biological. Coding also offers a level of control over an intelligent agent that’s not possible otherwise at all.You stop coding altogether for a few months and you will see that you become less introverted, more calm and more social. I have tried this myself.7. High ambitions and expectations:A med student while studying wants to become a good doctor and treat patients well. But usually in my experience, most of them don’t aspire to become surgeon general or open their own hospitals.In contrast, most tech people have a hidden aspiration to have a successful startup and evade through multiple classes of human society. And, technically it’s justified, as it happens a lot. But again not for everyone.And happiness is usually defined as reality - expectation.8. Skewed gender ratio:This is probably biased since I am a guy. But I have noticed that I am simply happier in environments where there are at least a few more women. Even 30-40% women makes a huge difference and completely changes the social dynamic. However, for us, I see that most meetings is basically all men. 80-90% of my colleagues are men. That’s too much average testosterone for a social circle to be healthy. It may sound sexist but it’s true.9. Comparison:Comparing TC to others is a sureshot way of making yourselves unhappy. It makes you feel like you are very likely getting shortchanged for the same amount of work.Solutions:If you have read until now, I would mention some solutions that can help you mitigate some of the above issues:1. Increase your marginal utility of money:Every time you get a new paycheck use some of it for fun money. It could be things that are totally silly but still make you happy. If you have high empathy, donate. Also spend money on people who have higher marginal utility, like your kids or partners. Don’t cheap out altogether and apply the same standards you apply to urself on them as well. As different people have different marginal utilities.Make a list of things that you can buy with money and that will genuinely make you happy. Keep adding to that list Whenever a thought comes into your mind about something you could buy that could make you happy.2. Choose work area according to your personality:If You like being a leader, getting attention and feeling the Power ( nothing wrong in that), then optimize for growth.If you are high empathy person, choose fields or slowly gravitate towards fields that help others.If you are a high wlb, family oriented person, acknowledge that and choose jobs accordingly.Understanding yourself is a very important step towards happiness.3. Increase social situations where you are not replaceable:Be it friends, family, hobby groups, or whatever. Start your own. Don’t let the personality traits induced by your high TC spill over into other areas of your life.4. For guys make more female friends. Or go to more situations where the gender ratios are better. Even if you have a partner. I promise it will make you happier or at least more balanced.5. Comparing to others I don’t think it’s completely unavoidable but keep in mind that in the end career is a class struggle. To go to the next class, you essentially have to get either very lucky or actually produce enough value to be in the next class.6. ‘Career is a class struggle and to go to next class, you have to produce value equivalent of next class’ - this one statement gave me a lot of peace about my career.In some way, I feel fortunate that where I am, I can already support myself and my family quite comfortably. I will try to go to next class, but not suck myself into the small game of comparing TCs. Or at least not let it suck my happiness.Will add more as they come to my mind.

They would also mock me by saying I am like a male nanny since I would help out my family with chores and stuff.Talking to them made my college experience worse since I felt fear of FOMO and I would day dream about going to parties and sharing those experiences with friends. They would encourage me to live alone or with friends etc but I knew that would be more financial burden than needed.As time went on, I have cut them out of my life. They would reach out to me every now and then if they had any question related to tech stuff since I work in tech but I don't bother talking to them and have blocked them on social media since sometimes they would ask me about about my relationship status and then flex about their hookups etcI am just wondering if I am being mentally and emotionally weak or doing the right thing by blocking them?TC: 91K#mentalhealth #bully #bullyingEDIT : It was hard for me to cut them off initially since I sort of admired this person.

I stated post office hours I talk to parents and I am not able to work on night and on weekends as I try to give them strength and I am occupied with family issues. To which all of a sudden he started taking notes and seeked confirmation .. so because of personal issues you are not able to work with full commitment. Am I right?

SAP,nomadEr88,"Dealing with a ""toxic"" family member","TLDR; I am taking advantage of this anonymous platform to vent out my feelings today. I am contemplating visiting a therapist but need to vent out anyways. I have a family member who's been toxic and controlling in my life (won't reveal gender). They have been highly successful and they've always been an inspiration to me. I looked up to them and celebrated their happiness always. But they've been extremely controlling and always played a victim. No matter how much I do, it's never enough. If I say no to one request, then they start thinking I don't care for them enough and says I feel lonely, I have no one. I have my own family and life but they expect I take decisions that revolve around their life. And makes me feel guilty if I take a decision that they're not happy about but which works for my family. There are a lot of other instances. For example, they say they're not happy with their marital life and always crib about how God has been unfair to them for giving such a spouse. But at the same time I see them being very close. Like my relationship with my spouse has been good (no complains) but even we don't talk with each other all the time. But if they stay apart for a few hours/days, they constantly text and call each other. They travel all the time, go out and do a lot of things together. It's not jealousy seeing them happy together coz I want them to be happy but I am confused as to how to react when they complain. At one moment they'll talk extremely negative about the spouse and the other moment they're happily together. They're also jealous about some of my life events and have said extremely toxic words to me. It's not that they've always been like this to me, they've been good and helpful to me in the past. That's why I am confused that I am not seeing their love but instead mistaking it for control. Cutting them out is not an option as they're immediate family.#confused #venting#mentalhealth",,2/11/2022,27,584,2,Family Issue,Mental Health
Intel,itpro12,Healing from burn out,"Hi, right now I've really been struggling with burn out from the covid pandemic, housing insecurity, politics and also from having only short term contracts. I just landed a 1 year contract doing lab compute support for the first time, before I was doing IT field service work and also did a couple of 3 month contracts. For housing I found another 6 month lease that isn't in a super great place but will get me by until I get my credit score fixed by paying down credit card debt. Currently my burn out has gotten to the point where I barely have any energy to do things like socialize or go back to school to get more IT certs so I can land a better paying job. What are some of the ways that I can start to heal from burn out and have the energy again to enjoy life and go to school? #burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,9/16/2022,4,335,1,Burnout,Burnout
Liberty Mutual Insurance,bci516,"Got Depression due to PIP, Need Help","Hello Blinders,Thanks for clicking this post and reading my story. Long story short, I worked as a data scientist and was PIPed within 4 months of hiring for my first full time job after graduation.Why I believe it was unfair:- 90% things listed on the PIP doc aren’t the fact. It was such a surprise to me, because I delivered everything I was assigned within pre-agreed timeline. My manager has inconsistent expectations before I dive into the project & after my work was delivered. For example, before I dive into a project, I estimated the time and asked my manager if it’s ok to deliver in 6 business days and do I need to notify any stakeholders. She said that’s fine and then I ended up with delivering in 5 business days. To me, it looks like I over-delivered, but my manager later says she’s expecting me to deliver in 3 business days.- There’s no measurable goals or actionable plans set up on the PIP doc, only one-sided criticism. I brought up this concern multiple times, and there’s still no measurable goals set up. And she said that’s the standard for everyone at my level. The problem is the standard is not quantified and can be judged subjectively.- After the PIP doc, my manager set up weekly coaching sessions (separate from weekly check-ins), during all the coaching sessions, she never told me how to improve or set up actionable plans/measurable goals for me to meet the expectations, only criticisms (like this does not meet expectations, you need to improve) without coaching me how.- I was being emotionally and verbally abused by her management style during the time working at the team. For example, she said ‘I want to caution you’ when I set up a survey seeking feedback for my work from colleagues without her approval.The inconsistent expectations and unsupportive manner from my manager has burned me out. I was upset that my manager couldn’t recognize my good work and couldn’t support me to improve. I reported this to HR and skip, but no one was on my side.Now I was diagnosed depression by multiple doctors and therapists, and I feel so hopeless. I’m afraid everyday that I will be terminated no matter how hard I tried. What should I do other than looking for new roles? Any advice would be very much appreciated.Thanks in advance for any advice you might offer.

Microsoft,lonelyroad,Introvert couple,Hi all. My husband and I are quite introverted by nature and don't have any friends or circle. We both are lately feeling lonely as we hardly have people we visit or people coming home. We have a 3 yr old and want to socialize more so that she can get company too. For example we want to organize a birthday party we find it socially anxious and awkward when 10 people come home as we are not the type that can crack jokes or energize the room. We are both unfortunately very boring by nature 😔 I often try hard to fit in but come off as giving advice or turn off people. I find it very difficult to entertain people and people often get bored or run out of things to talk. I sometimes feel we can never have a good social life and worried my daughter will also end up like that.

Throughout my childhood I've never seen my dad and mom fight over something, sure they've difference of opinion or have a say on others opinion or disagree verbally but never fight or argue or be rude to each other.My wife grew up observing constant fights in her childhood. Sure now, her parents don't fight much. I guess their relationship had matured overtime.Me and my wife met few years back, dated, fell in love and got married. I always observed one thing - she fights with me a lot. Fighting over small and silly things. I get that she wants few things certain way, I'm honestly trying to change myself but fighting simply doesn't solve anything. If I want to talk it through, I always make points in such a way that she can't win those arguments! I feel bad for this.Now after the fight, talk - she gets emotional and starts crying. I end up consoling her. For few days it's all good. And then the cycle repeats.If I say we need to talk about the whole situation, she avoids it, may be because I again put up points! I feel frustrated some times as I aint allowed to talk and resolve and I am always the one to pay the price! This is draining my mental energy.Please help what should I do.Edit: For people who are asking why did you marry her or saying diverce her - She's very caring person. And I like her for that.

Bloomberg,VlSx68,Brother told me to kill myself - should I forgive him?,"TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDEContext:I come from a traditional South Asian family. I was recently having mild suicidal thoughts to the point where I got scared when I was alone and called the police. They came with an ambulance and I spent the better part of the evening sobbing in the ER.I had to call someone to let them know where I was. I called my younger brother and told him what happened. He was out, but was worried and we talked about it the day after.A week goes by and we get into an argument that he started and it turns to insults and the insults continue to escalate from both sides. Eventually he tell me, ""You should have just killed yourself that night, everyone in the family would have been better off.""I told him that he crossed a line and caused a bit of a scene in front of his friends. It's been about a month and a half and I haven't talked to him sense.I don't plan to talk to him and want to distance myself as much as possible. However, my Mom keeps telling me to let it go (I don't think she understands suicide or doesn't want to as it's unpleasant for her to think about) and make up with him.I think that he will continue to be a toxic person in my life and have reservations.Question: Should I talk to him and try to move on?

Microsoft,Imvl80,"Diversity, Inclusion and Equity","Hi everyone. I need advice and your opinions.Before I start, i am what people call a “person of color, male and an immigrant in my low 30s from the middle east”. Don’t read if you get offended easily. This is purely, and genuinely a question I have, and if i’m wrong, i want to change.I’ve started to feel like this Diversity, inclusion and equity stuff is a bunch of bullshit. Every post I see on LinkedIn or internal MS is about a person of colour, gender calling out other person of colours, their genders to be more successful because they don’t get taken “seriously”.As a race, how did we all get to this? Why does it always have to be about someones gender, race, color or religion? Why can’t we just take people for merit and their work? Every post I see is either1.) we need more females in Finance and Tech!2.) we need more Middle Eastern and Black people everywhere in jobs!3.) we need abc because xyz!And then, I see females on LinkedIn saying how hard it is to handle career and home because their kids are young and its hard to handle them. I get it, it’s hard. But what do you want?Or posts like, i’m middle eastern and muslim so I automatically had less to work with and came from tough times. Or i’m black so i deserve this role!(I’m middle eastern) and i’m completely against this ideology.Why can’t we see that this Diversity, inclusion bullshit actually hurts the very people it’s for. Most of us are now labelled Diversity hires across companies. Since when did we all become such snowflakes? Since when did we all become so soft?If you disagree, read Jordan Peterson’s (UofT prof) response on DIE (diversity, inclusion and equity) culture.Tc: 180Yoe: 3#burnout #mentalhealth #diversity",180000,1/22/2022,26,607,3,Immigration Issue,Burnout

Roku,Soph14,Spouse business not making money,"Venting is all.Her background, she's an immigrant, went to school, worked as a nanny then a home assistant and had a part-time photo business, the pandemic hit and she decided to go full-time with it. It makes money, but the expenses are more than the sales. She wanted to spend full time on it, but I don't see it turning a big profit soon. She's emotionally attached to it so when we have conversations she gets very upset about it. Basically she feels she needs to spend in ""this"" and ""that"" including contractor labor, which I think isn't necessary. Most of the costs are rent for the business location.-She always has excuses for it, her co-renter isn't vaccinated, so she can't shoot there. She can't find another place. She wants to repaint the interior to make it cute, but it's like $2-5K. So she feels stuck on it.-Now she's venturing into a different kind of business (unrelated) to try to help with payments. Anyways, during all this, she was working on a website-We agreed to put $X amount toward the business that she can spend anyway she wants-Took a loan out with SBA due to the covid pandemicI help with the above, but you know, I can't make it my full-time job helping. So everything she wants is adjusting to what she wants for the business, ""we should buy a business location"" or ""we need a house because that would help with the business"". These aren't particularly smart, I think.Anyways, I don't see this as a real business and just a hobby that costs money (but mostly recoups through deductions). Of course, I support her doing it, but I'd wish she'd consider a WFH job that has little to no overhead/expenses. She was doing web work and buying ads, she I feel like she's tech savvy now (we worked together on it, glad she considered the non-Wix route, so she could learn HTML/CSS, how http requests work, etc.) as I think thats transferrable.We have other relationship problems and this sort of adds to it. I think she isn't good with this stuff and doesn't get that it doesn't help with buying a home, etc. At least get a part-time WFH job and do this part time. Essentially she only gets like 20 clients a year anyways, so there's a lot of open time.Qs: Yes we're in therapy, yes I've explained the above to her countless times that turns into fightsbusiness has been opportunity for 4 yearsTC: 400k",400000,1/30/2022,29,513,1,Immigration Issue,Therapy

Google,cancercat,My parents think it’s my responsibility to pay for my sister,"Just coming off of an emotionally winded text between my dad and I. Long story short, I recently took a trip across the country to send my sister off for college. Alone. She is an incoming freshmen, 5,000 miles away from home and the least he could have done was attempt to come. But because he owns a business (which is always his excuse), he can never make it to to anything, be it spend quality time with us or give us any emotional support.So, as a good big sister (I’m over a decade older), I take time off work, fly home, help her pack and buy all her school clothes, then take her across the country. We have a great time and I’m happy to do this. However, I did have to sacrifice a lot of my time from work to fly out there, plus taking care of all the expenses (hotels, food, car, school supplies, my own flights back home), which amounted to close to $3k.I asked my dad tonight if he could just Venmo me for half the hotel, which isn’t even that much. Because out of principle, I think he could have contributed more to this trip especially helping his youngest daughter move across the country. His typical sarcastic reaction was “why don’t you just pay for it”. Then all hell ensued.For context, I don’t mind giving to my sister and I don’t even need the money. But out of principle, I feel deeply taken advantage of by my parents when it comes to emotional, physical, and financial support. As the eldest I am expected to always give and give without ever receiving. I am the generous aunt that takes my sister shopping, the care-taking grandma, the helpful parent who helps with college essays and the big fun sister that stays up all night watching shows and giving advice about life. I am tired. Because I make a pretty good living, speak better English, and have more than two cells of emotional intelligence, I’ve basically assumed the parental and sibling figure in her life, while my parents get to run their multi-figure dollar business and have all the flexibility in life that doesn’t involve being a true parent.My dad’s reaction to me wanting a small sliver of support just broke me. He thinks all I care about is the money, whereas I actually just want to be treated as a equal member of the family that receives some support from time to time. I am OK with even contributing say 60%, but why is it so hard to meet me closer to halfway?Eventually my dad said, if it would make me happy, he’ll just Venmo me. I am just tired of the mind games and filial piety mind fuckery. How did I end up with the worst of both Chinese and American cultures? 😩 #endrant #family #burnoutUPDATE 1/4/21:First off thank you to everyone for the all of the supportive messages — I am glad to not be the only one who has gone through this type of generational immigrant parenting.I just wanted to update, that dad behaved very well to both me and sis over this holiday. I was actually very touched. For example, the night before my sis had to catch her flight, he asked if she needed any cash. When she said no, he still pulled out a $100 to give to her. He watched her pack and made sure she woke up on time, and even made us breakfast at 7am (this might sound basic, but seriously was surprised of his efforts. Typically, he would sleep in and just yell at us for waking him up). When I left, he asked if I was coming back next weekend.My writing earlier was out of such frustration, but looking back, I feel a renewed sense of hope towards my father. I know we won’t always see eye to eye, but the little moments in which he’s able to meet me halfway, means everything.",,10/9/2020,162,9853,92,Family Issue,Burnout

Google,peace ✌️,Why you are so unhappy despite a high TC (and what to do about it)?,"TLDR: a very long post that tries to explain human psychology behind why people are unhappy despite getting great compensation.I am writing this post as I see so many people here extremely unhappy despite making exceptionally high TCs for their age (including myself).My motivation for this post is my own reflections that revealed that even though my net worth increased ~10 times in last few years since I joined Google, overall I started to feel that I care more about money and react more negatively when I lost money or made a wrong buying decision. Moreover, I saw similar behaviors in many of my friends many of whom surprisingly were earlier very chilled out and carefree about spending money.As an avid learner and applicator of psychology, I did a lot of introspection and reflection to understand the root causes of this phenomenon. I describe them as follows:1. High TC implies very low marginal utility of money ( for me it’s 0):Imagine if someone gave you the equivalent of 2-3 month current salary when you were 16-18. How much fun could you have with that money in that age? When I first got my job, I bought a lot of things I really wanted like video games, gadgets and my own furniture. However, at this point, the addition of new paycheck simply doesn’t mean there is anything new I can buy. Whatever I want to buy, I can already buy. So, essentially marginal utility of money = 0 for me.I don’t mean to say that it’s better to have hand to mouth existence, but for most of us new paycheck doesn’t bring any new happiness or new capabilities except for increasing our bank numbers by a small percentage.2. With high TC, Career is a class struggle:Based on cause no. 1, I tried to ask myself this question about what will I do If I had tonnes of money, let’s say like 500 million dollars.You should ask this question to yourself before reading further. For me, my options were buying a big home with a nice view, having a full time personal chef, a home gym, a high quality personal trainer 3 times a week, good health care and spending lots of time with friends and family. And in addition, the freedom to work on projects that I really wanted to work on.If you categorize this, it’s mainly a few categories: home, health, time, family and freedom.Now here is the interesting part: to increase your TC marginally through promotion or higher bonus, you actually have to sacrifice all of these things 🤷‍♂️ you will have more work hours, less energy, poorer health and less family time.So, essentially what most people want from their careers is to be able to live the lifestyle of the next class, but tools at their disposal actually take them further away from the elements of the lifestyle of next class. And not everyone will make it to the next class unfortunately. These classes exist for a reason. Upward mobility is not so easy. That’s why so many people get stuck in their careers.So most of us are stuck in a very stable but unhappy equilibrium (or local minima of TC so to speak) where in either direction you don’t get extra happiness. Now some people can push through to make it to the next class, but not everyone will get there. Hence the quiet desperation 🤷‍♂️3. Leadership/growth vs. stress trade off:For most people, going up in career means higher stress at least for a while until they become VP equivalent or something.On the other hand, not going up in career means your peers will become your bosses which again means poor mental health as humans are inherently competitive ( and high achievers even more so).So essentially, another stable but unhappy equilibrium.4. Replaceability of labor in large corporate environments and lack of purpose:Given that the corporate systems such as FAANG are so giant, the value that each individual brings is far too low proportional to the entire system. This leads to a dynamic characterized by very high replaceability. But in general, humans don’t like to be considered replaceable. And, in fact humans are not indeed replaceable in most important relationships they have. Also such high degrees of replaceablity takes away any reasonable sense of purpose for doing our job for most people.Our real relationships such as parents, siblings, kids, partners are actually slot relationships and most of them can’t be refilled, at least not very easily.So in short, work relationships in big corporations are a very unnatural form of human relationships.5. Breadwinner anxiety:This is more true for guys ( I am a guy) but many women also feel it. It’s the constant anxiety of ensuring complete financial safety of your family. This is even worsened in the field of technology as its a relatively new and fast moving field and it’s not very clear how your career will progress and if you could become obsolete.This is usually not the case in fields like medicine. Technology can change and be automated but people will not. They will still keep getting sick 🤷‍♂️I believe, this is one of the reasons FIRE, and fatFIRE are becoming so popular in the tech community. I think it’s a response to unclear career progression for most people.Now some additional smaller reasons:6. Coding is a very unnatural form of intelligence task:Coding is not the same as working on an excel sheet. Because when you code it’s far more interactive and unpredictable than using a standard software. This affects your brain pathways as our brains are not designed to interact intelligently with such complex systems which are not biological. Coding also offers a level of control over an intelligent agent that’s not possible otherwise at all.You stop coding altogether for a few months and you will see that you become less introverted, more calm and more social. I have tried this myself.7. High ambitions and expectations:A med student while studying wants to become a good doctor and treat patients well. But usually in my experience, most of them don’t aspire to become surgeon general or open their own hospitals.In contrast, most tech people have a hidden aspiration to have a successful startup and evade through multiple classes of human society. And, technically it’s justified, as it happens a lot. But again not for everyone.And happiness is usually defined as reality - expectation.8. Skewed gender ratio:This is probably biased since I am a guy. But I have noticed that I am simply happier in environments where there are at least a few more women. Even 30-40% women makes a huge difference and completely changes the social dynamic. However, for us, I see that most meetings is basically all men. 80-90% of my colleagues are men. That’s too much average testosterone for a social circle to be healthy. It may sound sexist but it’s true.9. Comparison:Comparing TC to others is a sureshot way of making yourselves unhappy. It makes you feel like you are very likely getting shortchanged for the same amount of work.Solutions:If you have read until now, I would mention some solutions that can help you mitigate some of the above issues:1. Increase your marginal utility of money:Every time you get a new paycheck use some of it for fun money. It could be things that are totally silly but still make you happy. If you have high empathy, donate. Also spend money on people who have higher marginal utility, like your kids or partners. Don’t cheap out altogether and apply the same standards you apply to urself on them as well. As different people have different marginal utilities.Make a list of things that you can buy with money and that will genuinely make you happy. Keep adding to that list Whenever a thought comes into your mind about something you could buy that could make you happy.2. Choose work area according to your personality:If You like being a leader, getting attention and feeling the Power ( nothing wrong in that), then optimize for growth.If you are high empathy person, choose fields or slowly gravitate towards fields that help others.If you are a high wlb, family oriented person, acknowledge that and choose jobs accordingly.Understanding yourself is a very important step towards happiness.3. Increase social situations where you are not replaceable:Be it friends, family, hobby groups, or whatever. Start your own. Don’t let the personality traits induced by your high TC spill over into other areas of your life.4. For guys make more female friends. Or go to more situations where the gender ratios are better. Even if you have a partner. I promise it will make you happier or at least more balanced.5. Comparing to others I don’t think it’s completely unavoidable but keep in mind that in the end career is a class struggle. To go to the next class, you essentially have to get either very lucky or actually produce enough value to be in the next class.6. ‘Career is a class struggle and to go to next class, you have to produce value equivalent of next class’ - this one statement gave me a lot of peace about my career.In some way, I feel fortunate that where I am, I can already support myself and my family quite comfortably. I will try to go to next class, but not suck myself into the small game of comparing TCs. Or at least not let it suck my happiness.Will add more as they come to my mind.

SAP,nomadEr88,"Dealing with a ""toxic"" family member","TLDR; I am taking advantage of this anonymous platform to vent out my feelings today. I am contemplating visiting a therapist but need to vent out anyways. I have a family member who's been toxic and controlling in my life (won't reveal gender). They have been highly successful and they've always been an inspiration to me. I looked up to them and celebrated their happiness always. But they've been extremely controlling and always played a victim. No matter how much I do, it's never enough. If I say no to one request, then they start thinking I don't care for them enough and says I feel lonely, I have no one. I have my own family and life but they expect I take decisions that revolve around their life. And makes me feel guilty if I take a decision that they're not happy about but which works for my family. There are a lot of other instances. For example, they say they're not happy with their marital life and always crib about how God has been unfair to them for giving such a spouse. But at the same time I see them being very close. Like my relationship with my spouse has been good (no complains) but even we don't talk with each other all the time. But if they stay apart for a few hours/days, they constantly text and call each other. They travel all the time, go out and do a lot of things together. It's not jealousy seeing them happy together coz I want them to be happy but I am confused as to how to react when they complain. At one moment they'll talk extremely negative about the spouse and the other moment they're happily together. They're also jealous about some of my life events and have said extremely toxic words to me. It's not that they've always been like this to me, they've been good and helpful to me in the past. That's why I am confused that I am not seeing their love but instead mistaking it for control. Cutting them out is not an option as they're immediate family.#confused #venting#mentalhealth",,2/11/2022,27,585,2,Family Issue,Mental Health
Intel,itpro12,Healing from burn out,"Hi, right now I've really been struggling with burn out from the covid pandemic, housing insecurity, politics and also from having only short term contracts. I just landed a 1 year contract doing lab compute support for the first time, before I was doing IT field service work and also did a couple of 3 month contracts. For housing I found another 6 month lease that isn't in a super great place but will get me by until I get my credit score fixed by paying down credit card debt. Currently my burn out has gotten to the point where I barely have any energy to do things like socialize or go back to school to get more IT certs so I can land a better paying job. What are some of the ways that I can start to heal from burn out and have the energy again to enjoy life and go to school? #burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,9/16/2022,4,336,1,Burnout,Burnout
Liberty Mutual Insurance,bci516,"Got Depression due to PIP, Need Help","Hello Blinders,Thanks for clicking this post and reading my story. Long story short, I worked as a data scientist and was PIPed within 4 months of hiring for my first full time job after graduation.Why I believe it was unfair:- 90% things listed on the PIP doc aren’t the fact. It was such a surprise to me, because I delivered everything I was assigned within pre-agreed timeline. My manager has inconsistent expectations before I dive into the project & after my work was delivered. For example, before I dive into a project, I estimated the time and asked my manager if it’s ok to deliver in 6 business days and do I need to notify any stakeholders. She said that’s fine and then I ended up with delivering in 5 business days. To me, it looks like I over-delivered, but my manager later says she’s expecting me to deliver in 3 business days.- There’s no measurable goals or actionable plans set up on the PIP doc, only one-sided criticism. I brought up this concern multiple times, and there’s still no measurable goals set up. And she said that’s the standard for everyone at my level. The problem is the standard is not quantified and can be judged subjectively.- After the PIP doc, my manager set up weekly coaching sessions (separate from weekly check-ins), during all the coaching sessions, she never told me how to improve or set up actionable plans/measurable goals for me to meet the expectations, only criticisms (like this does not meet expectations, you need to improve) without coaching me how.- I was being emotionally and verbally abused by her management style during the time working at the team. For example, she said ‘I want to caution you’ when I set up a survey seeking feedback for my work from colleagues without her approval.The inconsistent expectations and unsupportive manner from my manager has burned me out. I was upset that my manager couldn’t recognize my good work and couldn’t support me to improve. I reported this to HR and skip, but no one was on my side.Now I was diagnosed depression by multiple doctors and therapists, and I feel so hopeless. I’m afraid everyday that I will be terminated no matter how hard I tried. What should I do other than looking for new roles? Any advice would be very much appreciated.Thanks in advance for any advice you might offer.

We both are lately feeling lonely as we hardly have people we visit or people coming home. We have a 3 yr old and want to socialize more so that she can get company too. For example we want to organize a birthday party we find it socially anxious and awkward when 10 people come home as we are not the type that can crack jokes or energize the room. We are both unfortunately very boring by nature 😔 I often try hard to fit in but come off as giving advice or turn off people. I find it very difficult to entertain people and people often get bored or run out of things to talk. I sometimes feel we can never have a good social life and worried my daughter will also end up like that.

Google,cancercat,My parents think it’s my responsibility to pay for my sister,"Just coming off of an emotionally winded text between my dad and I. Long story short, I recently took a trip across the country to send my sister off for college. Alone. She is an incoming freshmen, 5,000 miles away from home and the least he could have done was attempt to come. But because he owns a business (which is always his excuse), he can never make it to to anything, be it spend quality time with us or give us any emotional support.So, as a good big sister (I’m over a decade older), I take time off work, fly home, help her pack and buy all her school clothes, then take her across the country. We have a great time and I’m happy to do this. However, I did have to sacrifice a lot of my time from work to fly out there, plus taking care of all the expenses (hotels, food, car, school supplies, my own flights back home), which amounted to close to $3k.I asked my dad tonight if he could just Venmo me for half the hotel, which isn’t even that much. Because out of principle, I think he could have contributed more to this trip especially helping his youngest daughter move across the country. His typical sarcastic reaction was “why don’t you just pay for it”. Then all hell ensued.For context, I don’t mind giving to my sister and I don’t even need the money. But out of principle, I feel deeply taken advantage of by my parents when it comes to emotional, physical, and financial support. As the eldest I am expected to always give and give without ever receiving. I am the generous aunt that takes my sister shopping, the care-taking grandma, the helpful parent who helps with college essays and the big fun sister that stays up all night watching shows and giving advice about life. I am tired. Because I make a pretty good living, speak better English, and have more than two cells of emotional intelligence, I’ve basically assumed the parental and sibling figure in her life, while my parents get to run their multi-figure dollar business and have all the flexibility in life that doesn’t involve being a true parent.My dad’s reaction to me wanting a small sliver of support just broke me. He thinks all I care about is the money, whereas I actually just want to be treated as a equal member of the family that receives some support from time to time. I am OK with even contributing say 60%, but why is it so hard to meet me closer to halfway?Eventually my dad said, if it would make me happy, he’ll just Venmo me. I am just tired of the mind games and filial piety mind fuckery. How did I end up with the worst of both Chinese and American cultures? 😩 #endrant #family #burnoutUPDATE 1/4/21:First off thank you to everyone for the all of the supportive messages — I am glad to not be the only one who has gone through this type of generational immigrant parenting.I just wanted to update, that dad behaved very well to both me and sis over this holiday. I was actually very touched. For example, the night before my sis had to catch her flight, he asked if she needed any cash. When she said no, he still pulled out a $100 to give to her. He watched her pack and made sure she woke up on time, and even made us breakfast at 7am (this might sound basic, but seriously was surprised of his efforts. Typically, he would sleep in and just yell at us for waking him up). When I left, he asked if I was coming back next weekend.My writing earlier was out of such frustration, but looking back, I feel a renewed sense of hope towards my father. I know we won’t always see eye to eye, but the little moments in which he’s able to meet me halfway, means everything.",,10/9/2020,162,9854,92,Family Issue,Burnout

My VP is not supportive and has piled so much work on me that it's become unmanageable unless I work like 10 to 12 hour days.I have a qbr today for client x and have a mtg during the qbr for client z for mmm model updates. Informed the analytics folks at client z, they're fine and cool with it. The account director immediately emails me and my vp saying this is unacceptable who's covering for me. I said my vp would. My vp then messages me that she would bit she's out sick (but this is not mentioned in her cal or slack). As a director I should be allowed to not attend mtgs when I have other higher priorities than what is a 10 min update. It's really ridiculous and is taxing me.For months I've felt I'm being scapegoated for a lot of short comings on the company's legacy bureaucracy and my vp's lack of support, help, or presence. I have felt completely alone handling everything by myself while being short staffed on my team, and now she just throws work and client at me without my consent or asking my availability.I'm trying my best to detach and focus on interviewing for other better roles, I just feel like the past 7 months of the effort and leadership I put in we're wasted and completely trashed on. Kinda feel like I wasted my life. I spent all of last year getting to a good place mentally and feel I've regressed and gone into a depression from work. It's pretty common for folks in account management to bully, be territorial and act very petty.

Sure I can, but that's not the point why I’m here writing this.I have been through different scientific therapies, such as TMS, and therapy sessions, but I don’t think they worked well.Some of you will say to own up. Be strong and suck it up. Well, these are the exact words I tell myself everyday.Some peoole would consider me as someone who’s smart and has all the answers.But you know what...For some reason, I always ended up making the wrong decisions no matter how hard I try. It’s the impulsiveness and desperation of wanting to feel something, anything.That’s the problem. Me.I feel like I am at the end of the road. I hope someone out there could understand, but at the same time, I don't expect people to help.Its exhausting.After all, we all have our problems to take care of.I want to remind everyone to be there for each other.I know it's not easy to be nice all the time, but sometimes, a simple reminder that you can say to someone.... “everything will be okay” goes a long way.I am immigrant who had to hustle his way through everything He has right now, who is in mountain of debt, a loner and a sucker for anything.A person who fought countless of times, yet never met an adversary who could offer him the simple Life that He wishes for.To end, I believe Life is beautiful.

EY,EYAYAY,Mental Peace Vs Career Growth,Just took an offer from Google ($151k + 15%bonus + 261k/4 years - PgM) instead from a Pre IPO Startup ($210k + 15%bonus + 7000RSU/$70per share) - Data work.The work at startup was related to my field and was more technical than the role at Google. I was inclined towards the startup but didnt want to get in a rabbit hole of taking so many responsibilities on myself and feeling stressed about work after work.The last 5 years at EY had me pretty burnt out and was starting to get frustated and irritated at small things. I wanted to start a fresh and feel more free. I just want to experience life and focus on myself instead of work all the time.It was so hard to make a decision between the two but I went with Google due to WLB and flexible schedule.I still think about this decision I made to go to Google because I wanted mental peace and less of stress at this time. I just feel that I dont want to regret this at a later point in my career and my growth might get impacted.Has anyone ever made a decision like this in their career?#burnout #mentalhealth #google,,3/13/2022,14,926,8,Burnout,Stress

Bloomberg,ykhX11,Did some soul searching and introspection and I want to talk about this horrible team that I was part of.,"So at Bloomberg, there is no transparency into ratings. No levels or grades. If you have >3 years of experience you automatically become a senior software engineer. The only way you find out that you got the promotion is by getting an employment verification letter. This gives the TLs a lot of power. All they have to do is write you a couple of paragraphs of text during your Eval and all you can do is read those paragraphs several times over to try to understand how you did in a given year. Bloomberg was my first job out of college and the first team I picked was a very toxic team. For a long time, I kept blaming myself for the crap that I endured in that team. Today I did some soul searching and I wanted to present things from my POV for closure.My TL for 3.5 years was lying through his teeth on how I was doing a wonderful job in my evals. That I am always challenging the status quo and taking the initiative and stuff. He didn't increase my rating for 3.5 years and finally, when I left the team, he told my next TL to let my ratings remain the same for the year I left his team. My TC increased barely from 140K to 183K in the 4.5 years that I worked at BBG. The skip level manager in my second team told me about my ratings when I asked him why I was getting paid so less.There were some obvious writings on the wall that my rating hasn't gone up. I was not getting along with my teammates and there were a lot of fights. People were not allowing me to finish my projects. They wouldn't answer my questions, they wouldn't approve my tickets, PRs. But he made all of that shit sound positive in evals. He made it seem like being rebellious is encouraged in his team. I was picking up fights extensively with my teammates thinking that I am doing the right thing. I was forcibly trying to introduce Apache Spark into my team and the people in my team who were in their 50s or late 40s were reluctant to even migrate to CMake from an old build system written in Perl & Make. I developed a sort of PTSD from that ordeal. I started grinding my teeth in sleep. On two occasions, I broke down and cried in front of my TL. They forced me into an EAP program to cover their asses.The worst thing is that my TL was writing the same shit in other people's Eval too. A loud-mouth fellow in my team used to repeat all of the crap from his Eval during standup meetings. There was constant infighting in the team. For every single task in the team, there were two sets of systems developed. Every time a project manager would come to us and ask us to implement a feature, there would be screaming matches in the team to decide who would get to implement it.There was a department-wide initiative to use a set of tools built in-house in that department for certain tasks and one of my teammates literally rebelled against that order and built his own crappy, extremely buggy, rigid, inflexible system in Python. My TL literally fought for this dude's crap with the department's ""director"" and the ""director"" caved in. Nobody in the team knew what this guy's python non-sense did except for him. He wouldn't maintain any documentation for it. He wouldn't answer any questions on it. People had to build ""plugin-ins"" for his shit. He was inventing concepts for his crappy system that we had to learn them. It used to take so many days to build those crappy plugins. And he kept on adding more crap to it, so every time you touch it, you would end up wasting hours and days of your time. Anytime you catch a bug in his crappy system, he would say ""how come only you are facing this issue, why is no one else in the team facing this problem."" :|The HR got involved multiple times in these fights. Surprisingly no one was fired.And the fucking TL was also not happy. There were at least one or two WPs every week. My TL would routinely get up at 2:00 AM twice a week to put off fires.",,1/2/2022,22,1262,12,Toxic Manager,PTSD

Meta,Metapunk,Anxiety and depression are exhausting,"Summary:- It's exhausting both mentally and physically- It causes weird things to happen in your body- It's a vicious cycle that you need to learn to control and break- See someone and use your company benefits- Optimize for personal growthContext:This post is to vent a little bit as I had one of my worse panic/anxiety attacks. I've dealt with anxiety almost my entire life ever since middle school, but starting as simple phobias such as heights and wind blowing me away. It eventually evolved into social anxiety in college with me resorting to alcohol to get along in social events.Issues:Now in my professional life, with wfh and not seeing many faces, not having a life partner, and living alone, my anxiety has skyrocketed. I also have very little time to myself due to work.I've been going back to the office and often run out of the campus cafes early due to anxiety while I'm in like or eating. I also feel anxious when talking to people, constantly worrying about what they'll think about me when/if I have an attack in front of them.After these attacks, the recovery phase can range from a few minutes to hours, perhaps even a day, for my heart rate and mental state to return to normal. Your body is going through a lot of crap and your brain is processing so many thoughts and emotions; it's overloaded. It's not only exhausting requiring a recovery phase, but it's exhausting to try and get to work on improving it because of the time and effort you put into exercises and digging in to find the root cause.Approach:Anxiety is a normal part of life, but it should not take hold of you and prevent you from going places because it makes you uncomfortable. I've been seeing a therapist with a degree through my Lyra benefit; not one of the in-house therapists with a simple license who are part of the Lyra platform. We've been going through evidence-backed exercises in helping out my anxiety. I find this helpful in allowing me to analyze after the fact and zooming out with exploration of alternative perspectives in each scenario and each mood I have. During attacks I find myself breaking the loop earlier and ""snapping out of it"" to come back to reality sooner.This is not to say that evidence-backed exercises will help everyone. I'd recommend trying out different approaches as completing the exercises can be draining and add extra workload to your life where it starts to feel like a chore. I personally will be looking for someone I can talk to on the side as a supplement who can help me decompress my thoughts, feelings, and emotions without feeling like I need to commit to or deliver anything per session.I'll be leaving Facebook as I personally feel a lot of stress comes from my coworkers, the culture, my managers, and the expectations on me as an IC7 TL. I may even be taking a downlevel on the way out (most likely towards Google) and will be prioritizing a team that cares for one another with respect and boundaries. It'll be hard to find that team, but I've learned a few signals on how to spot BS that will hopefully aid my team match.I want to focus on other facets of my life and optimize for personal growth by taking care of myself, spending time with family, putting myself out there to seek friend circles, and get back into shape.Links:- If you're unaware of the distinction between panic and anxiety attacks: https://www.healthline.com/health/panic-attack-vs-anxiety-attack#symptoms- Anxiety Exercises: https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-exercises- Lyra: https://www.lyrahealth.com/- Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-8255 | https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #anxiety #panic",,3/15/2022,5,619,16,Family Issue,Stress
Palo Alto Networks,Zelenskiii,Paranoid nights and anxiety with bad dreams,"M29 single. Quite laid back, jovial, I try to build good conversations and have a positive outlook of life in general.I usually have dreams almost everyday, with most of them ending up as a bad one. It wasn't an issue after all until yesterday.Last night had few beers alone (was drinking from evening to night for 3-4 hours) and slept off. I woke up in the middle of the night with heavy heart beatings after having a really bad dream. After that I wasn't able to sleep almost the entire night. Was using the phone but started feeling really REALLY ANXIOUS - Haven't felt like that ever before in my LIFE. Started browsing social media but I uninstalled all social media apps as I felt really overwhelming after having gush of emotions and thoughts, started questioning my actions and conversations with people in the past and whether it's right or wrong. This might go as the worst night I have ever had. I can't process this Monday morning, feeling mentally/physically drowned and the day has just begun.

Pretty much every person that I hang out with, especially girls, are married to/in a relationship with someone they met in school, college, work etc. Nobody ever shows any interest in me. It feels like the more someone gets to know me, the more they want to stay away? I somehow don't elicit any feelings of attraction or love from others, it is probably just camaraderie and respect. I console myself that I have a lot of friends but then realize that I am not anybody's number one. I am not that friend they would call in the middle of the night.

Squarespace,zyqg86,Can anyone share their experiences with cognitive behavioral therapy?,"I have always lived in my head a lot - constant overthinking, worrying, ruminating. Over time I have figured out how to cope with some of these emotions to prevent them from dominating my life. I went through a phase of reading a lot of self help books and self development videos and while some were a complete waste of time others were helpful in certain ways - I actually improved my life a lot through self learning. However, I haven’t done any self care in years, I just try to stay afloat at work and visit my family when I can, at this point I’m completely burned out, depressed, directionless and those invasive thought patterns are starting to return. I know I need to talk to someone, but I have no idea how or where to start with therapy. I did talk therapy for a year or so a while ago, but haven’t been back in many years. I’m wondering, for those of you that have found success with talk therapy or CBT, where do I even start? What do I look for, and how do I begin? If I have great insurance, do I look there first? Should I expect to pay out of pocket? I understand that it might take some time to find the right person, but I’m hoping for some guidance around where to look and how to begin the process of helping myself. With all the mental health services available now, it feels like I’m swimming in the middle of the ocean.

The Home Depot,scoobydo3,Lack of sex drive (asexual ?!),"Hi all, So I have been experiencing a lack of sex drive or even an interest in masterbating since almost a year. I’m in late twenties, unmarried and haven’t been sexually active much, but I did have sex. This is preventing me from dating too as I know I wouldn’t be able to have sex or get sexually attracted by anyone as of now ( already experienced this with a few dates ). Consulted a few kinds of docs and they feel it’s a mental thing but I’m unable to fix it with just mental affirmations. I have had depression in the past but now I do workout and I am a healthy person. Not sure if it’s just general depression or something related only to sex. Wanted to see if anyone else is in the same boat and how they overcame things like this. Thanks guys !#depression #mentalhealth #sexuality",,10/19/2020,171,15000,50,Others,Mental Health

I was there for 6 years, the burnout and mental damage it made to my life cannot be quantified, but I managed to get out, so there's that.I literally took the first offer that came my way, and transitioned back to a product marketing manager role. I didn't care about anything.. but quitting and a leap in compensation. So now, 2 weeks in my new job, which I wasn't really happy about... I regret my choice even more.The environment and people are nice, and they treat you like a human being (didn't happen before) but the company is actually a startup and the chaos is pretty common. Got no onboarding, and basically the approach they use is dive or die. After just one week, I was already contributing to tasks.Now, I am not very happy about this. Also because everything is an emergency and there is no time to breathe...no company organisation, most teams are understaffed... It's a mess...the company appears to be very healthy and growing...

MITRE,jjh221,Relationship affecting my mental…,"I’ve been dating my S/O for a few years now. She’s at the end of her school career (finishing her graduate studies) and I’ve noticed a profound shift in her attitude and how she treated me.For the longest time she always told me I was too money focused and life was about more than TC. She has told me I’m pessimistic, sometimes a drag, etc.She has grown up around money her entire life via where she went to school and her friends, but her family itself is not actually that wealthy.In the last few months of school she’s been partying a lot and in general her overall tone has changed with me. I pointed this out and she more or less admitted she was having trouble coming to terms with the fact that she was graduating, going into the corporate world, and ultimately together we were not going to have much money/freedom as she originally assumed we would. She also admitted she was not sure if we were a good fit for each other long term.Recently her good friend ended up dating some guy with generational wealth and she got into a big fight with her about how it was annoying how she talked about it: “we all wish we had a millionaire boyfriend” kind of argument and vented to me about it.I don’t know it just made me feel shitty. I thought money wasn’t everything? But apparently you’re very jealous of your friend?I’ve had a lot of confidence issues since the beginning of the pandemic and I don’t know if I’m overreacting and being too emotional or if she is treating me poorly or what. I’ve tried to improve myself and be more positive and compromise more with her. I just don’t know if I’m the problem or not.I don’t know what to do besides sticking to my plan of just controlling what I can and if it works out it works out… I really do love her, but I’ve felt kind of like she has intentionally taken punches at me in the last couple of months and I’m scared to get confrontational about these things that bother me because then she says all we do is fight and we fight so much more than any other couple she knows so I’ve just been avoiding it.Edit: Thank you for the feedback everyone.

Struggling to get up from bed and debug even minor issues and complete tasks at work. I live alone and don't have any friends to talk. I have social anxiety but more than that lower mood is affecting my life. It's am experiencing this since 3-4 years but pushed myself so far and it's getting more and more difficult. I did blood tests and everything else is normal. Therapy didn't help. Last year my physician had recommended SSRI(Lexapro) but I didn't take it as I don't want to create dependency on SSRIs. I know going out will help but I find it scary to walk in Seattle downtown alone (I keep turning back and get more conscious to see if anyone is following me due to some crime documentaries I watched and my past experience while walking alone). Gym is just too boring and the interior of gym doesn't make me feel refreshed. Changing jobs will bring some positivity to me but I have difficulty to even prepare for interviews.

Lack of experience in the domain.2. Lack of confidence induced by missed delivery targets due to 1.What I feel:1. I know and acknowledge my underperformance. Call me brave to put it out or dumb to be slow, but I need time to understand the tech that I work with and wouldn't want to ship garbage code and then make the life of oncall horrible.2. I have hidden the fact that I'm PIPed from my parents. The reason? They've suffered and sacrificed enough for me. No point in telling them about a problem they can't help me with. But they understand that something's wrong. And the fact that I have to keep dodging their questions hurts me even more. Not being able to freely talk with my parents for the last 2 months is a major confidence sucker for me.3. I am LCing. But the replies are slow.4. I thrive in an encouraging environment (who doesn't). I don't have that Cristiano Ronaldo mentality (yet) that can help me survive in adverse scenarios. I crumble emotionally.5. I feel depressed cause I've gone from multiple offers in hand to a guy who's struggling to implement basic routines.6. Do I need help? Sure I do.

Optum,RSwY88,My sibling is failing school,"My sister is in her 5th year at a university, and I happen to open her laptop and see her grades last semester which was pretty bad. I was curious and scrolled and saw rest of her grades for past few years, she's basically failing or barely scraping her classes. When I asked her about it, she says she's doing just fine and not to worry. She also got pretty defensive. I want her to be willing to tell me, and not have me force her to.What would you do in this situation? Please consider that she is in her 5th year in school, and not even in her major yet.Edit: Thanks for everyone's opinion! I really appreciate it.

But as an older brother, it's also my duty to make sure she walks the right path. Sure I can't control her and I shouldn't, but imagine if you had a sibling you knew was struggling, would you just let them be? I am probably her number one supporter when it comes to her education, and I seriously want her to do well and graduate. She has been lying to me for years about her grades, and basically has been failing. I thought about waiting and letting her reach out to me instead, but at this rate, she will pretty much be dropping out of school with a big debt, the best I can do is try to understand where she is failing and how I can help her.",,12/30/2021,28,942,3,Family Issue,Others

Meta,fsakaks,Emotional regulation,"Two years ago, I decided to take a better look at my life. I was usually either too sad or euphorically delighted and was never really happy with anything.I got bored with relationships fast. I saw people or situations as black or white. I was emotionally immature.I gradually spent more time reading psychology books to see what could be wrong with me. And finally found the answer (or I think I did). These are traits of personality adaptions due to inconsistent or negligible parenting combined with genetics.There seemed to be evidence-based treatments for it.I’m just writing this, so maybe someone else who has been experiencing difficult emotions as far as they can remember could read it and seek emotional regulation treatments.Most cases of emotional immaturity can be attributed to your experiences during the first few years of your life. And it’s not fair for a few years to shape someone’s entire life like that.I also believe many people on this app have experienced lousy or traumatizing parenting. So I assume many have emotional immaturity issues.It took me a long time to realize the oddness of my thinking patterns. The thing is, your thinking patterns are all you know. You cannot easily understand they’re maladaptive. For instance, the first thing I start to subconsciously analyze when interacting with someone is whether or not they like me. It’s like my life mission had been a quest for the love I didn’t receive from my parents.Or for instance, if someone has narcissistic adaptations, the first thing they subconsciously start to analyze when interacting with someone would be to assess their social hierarchy, prestige, looks, and power.I’ve been going to therapy. All personality issues are lifelong. But knowledge makes a huge difference. I know the theory behind it when I experience an irrationally negative or positive emotion, which helps me use the skills I’ve learned to manage them.",,3/17/2022,12,486,7,Family Issue,Therapy

Bloomberg,Rasr83,I never asked to be born. I was forcibly dragged into this world.,"I really hate my life a lot and I am really angry at my mom for giving birth to me. She had an arranged marriage in her 20s. Her husband used to beat her. She had an inverted uterus and she couldn't conceive that easily. She got a divorcee. She got another arranged marriage because being a divorcee in the 80s in India is unimaginably hard.My father is a chemical engineer from a reputable college but he often struggled with staying employed because there wasn't much demand for Chemical engineers back in the 90s and 00s. He is also a divorcee and his first marriage was a love marriage, he had a son and the divorcee was very rough on him. He only married again because he needed someone to take care of him, cook him food and wash his clothes. He never loved my mother or me. He used to beat me a lot, he was never affectionate to me.Now they both got married when they were around 35 years of age. They had severe money problems. Both of them suffered from depression. Both of them were angry at their ex-partners. My dad used to take it out on my mom and my mom used to cry often. My mom consistently had health problems too. She had an enlarged liver, diabetes, and all. She was not a great student either. She is not that smart. Any sane person in my mom's place would not have kids in that situation. Even my father was against having kids. But she was adamant that she wanted kids and forced my father to have me. My father literally lost his job when my mom was pregnant. She literally got pregnant 7 months after she got married the second time. She didn't even wait to see if her second husband would be as abusive as her first husband. Her only concern was that if she delayed getting pregnant by a couple of more years, she would never be able to conceive.Now, I am miserable as hell in my life. I had a very chaotic childhood. My father hated me a lot and that caused me to develop a lot of emotional issues. I have health problems too. I am not athletic, I cannot climb more than 2 flights of stairs. I have knee pain and I am 29 years old. I have an auto-immune disease that is eating away my skin and my hair. I am really really dumb. My mom had shitty grades all throughout school and I had shitty grades all throughout my academic career. I look just as ugly as my parents. I have no social skills. I don't know how the hell I got the SDE job at Bloomberg. Everyone in my team thinks I am dumb. And I know I am dumb.The thing is, both my mom and dad would have been happy if they wouldn't have had me. If only she waited for a couple of years, their marriage would have bloomed and they would have grown fond of each other. Neither am I happy today nor are they. Now they want me to get arranged married too. I told my dad that there is no way in hell I am going to get married and he stopped talking to me altogether. Every day he shouts at my mom for not forcing me to get married.",,3/17/2021,74,5045,47,Indians Issue,Others

Amazon,tripo,Fragile,"Mental health post.My dad was in the hospital in and out a lot over the last few years, but early this year would be his last. Between me, my mom and my brother we would take turns on who would wait at the hospital while he was in ICU. This had become a routine for us, so we were quite used to it by now. He pulled through every single time. But this time was different. He had lost his speech. He was barely attentive and could only talk with his eyes. He was a very lively person. He filled the room he was in, it was sad to see him this way.The time I would get with him, I would put up bits from his favorite stand up from the likes of Robin Williams and Richard Pryor. I could see him process it and would smile, sometimes even chuckle. It made me happy and broke my heart at the same time. Then one night it finally happened. While I was at the hospital that night, he had a cardiac event. They somehow revived his heartbeat. I called my brother and mom. We all waited outside while doctors did their bit. His heart started giving out the final time and his heartbeat started dropping. My dad loved math and he created interest for the subject in me as well. The rate at which the heartbeat was falling, I knew how long it would take for it to end.And it finally did. Just like that he was gone and it was over. It was so surreal at the time that I couldn't process it. He lay there as if he was sleeping and would get up. It was weird but suddenly people started to refer to him as ""the body"" and not by his name as we made arrangements for his funeral.I've reflected a lot on those 2 weeks. And have a different perspective on life. Our bodies are fragile vessels for the life in it. We have been successful at protecting over time, but it still is a fragile vessel. It is an amazing chemistry that is our consciousness. The minute it's gone, we are not ourselves, we are just ""the body"". Life is unpredictable and time is fleeting. Life changed for me that day, I thought about how our existence is a result of amazing coincidences and how easily it can go. We must cherish the chance to experience this world around us and never lose sight of how lucky we are.

SAS,The_Doctor,AMA: Psychologist working in data - concerned with COVID’s impact on whole person care,"A licensed psychologist, I was previously San Bernardino County Department of Behavioral Health’s Chief of Behavioral Health Informatics. Now, I help public sector health agencies use data and analytics to support a person-centered approach to improving health outcomes. (I’m also a huge Star Trek fan.)COVID-19 has sparked fear and anxiety all over the world. People are scared they or a loved one will catch it, but are also dealing with massive disruptions to their lives and the loneliness of isolation. Now, more than ever, we should talk about whole person care, which considers physical and behavioral health but also the effects of socioeconomic and other factors. But the stigma and discrimination associated with mental health and substance misuse still keeps too many from seeking help.Too often, public behavioral health programs are measured based on negative criteria (unnecessary hospitalizations, incarcerations, school failure, homelessness). However, if we only focus on negative outcomes, how does that affect our narratives around behavioral health? Could we unintentionally be creating a negative, stigmatizing culture?Some questions you might consider include:If you’re working from home, how can you maintain your own whole person care?Where can you find behavioral health resources?What role can data and analytics play in getting people the help they need?DISCLAIMER: My responses are for informational purposes only and should not be used as direct medical care or advice.

I’ve had this problem my entire life and have only been able to progress once I “stopped caring” usually because there suddenly aren’t any stakes or people have low expectations of me. Once that happens, then I’m actually able to focus and do well. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me, but as I get older, this becomes that much more unsustainable.

Amazon,jjeeff,Corporate Stockholm Syndrome?,"Have you ever experienced Corporate Stockholm Syndrome? Where and why?Corporate Stockholm Syndrome can be defined as employees of a business beginning to identify with—and being deeply loyal to—an employer who mistreats them (defined in this situation as verbal abuse, demanding overly long hours, and generally ignoring the wellbeing and emotional needs of the employee)....The employee will also rationalize to themselves and to others the employer’s poor treatment of them as necessary for the good of the organization as a whole, and angrily defend the employer’s actions when those actions are questioned by an outsider. In other words, denial of the obvious....The worker experiencing these symptoms is at risk for significant emotional trauma.

My mentor assigned is not in the office very often and when he is in, he’s distracted due to a valid personal outside of work reasons. I don’t blame him, he’s going through a lot. So I’m asking what do I even gain out this leadership development program? I essentially am just a normal engineer as if had I not been hired via a new grad leadership development program.My job is super isolating being in a separate office away from the main salaried staff. All my coworkers will be x2 or x3 my age with kids my age. The corporate has reneged on me twice on transfering me to a more populated area despite me putting in delivering excellent work and the software used is pretty outdated with low industry adoption/ legacy support. They aren’t willing to provide access to SQL queries which would limits leverage my stats abilities/ and DOE skill sets. And I am highly concerned of what new technical skillsets i will gain if I stay on for another 1 year +. And tbh I’m longer interested in manufacturing or at least working fully on the plant side.Plus they’re about to ship me out to the middle of nowhere for my next rotation. It’s a town in nowhere with less than 5k people average age of 40. and I am a bit concerend about the type of people I will meet there.They promise to interview me for a corporate role after the 1 year + rotation. But I’m take that with a grain of salt given I’ve been flaked on before and it would be an interview not a guarantee.My mental health from working 50+ weeks, living in the middle of nowhere, having only 1 friend I’ve made here,is taking severe hits. I burned out despite only being 1 year out of college.

The pandemic and time zone differences made it really too hard to work and the possibility of never going back home made us end things. Got sad, and kinda was just with myself and friends for a long time.Until recently (5 months ago) me this girl. First girl after a really long time who I actually liked. Opened up to the girl about my past let her know how I felt in the past and now about her. Let her know that between the time after Ex and before her there were couple other hookups, but just hookups and nothing more. A guy has needs, and she understood.She also let me know that she liked me and felt really attached and all this bs. But the problem through out these 5/6 months she never left dating apps. Continued to talk and see other guys. Don’t think she slept with other guys but continued to go out with people she met through dating apps. I confronted her about this behavior as I had already left dating apps and was only having seggs with her. This girl she expected me to be there for her all the time. Emotional, mental, physical she needed all kinds of support all the time. When asked to be my gf she never said yes and always used to just say she has a bad past with her Ex and needs time to recover and this and that, but in the end throw smth like I really like you and care for you.Calling me and texting me through out the day. Not letting me sleep at night because she needs someone to talk to. When we are actually hanging out treating me like trash and throwing me around.Finally I said I have had enough of this even tho I had feelings for her. And I let her know this is too much I can’t have this. You never took me seriously, and I’ve felt down because of you many times. And now this girl comes back to say, are you just gonna go like that? Don’t you want to try to make this work. Do you even care about this? And in my head I’m like ma’am you’re the one who didn’t take me seriously, who didn’t respect my feelings and all and now coming back to my with this bs.

It is intensified (and maybe caused by burnout in the first place) due to a stressful team which is adding to my misery. It has always been bad at work, but I learnt to navigate through my job. But, after several years, I feel I cannot take it any more.I am trying to get a new job that can help me get peace and restore my mental health. But the preparation takes time and mental sanity which I am trying to deal with, unfortunately. So, wanted to ask how you fellow blinders deal with this - when work pressure is mounting, and you want to get out, but lack mental peace to do so. Taking a week or two off doesn't seem to be helping..On a visa, so cannot leave.It doesn't help that I am not able to get interview calls either.#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #referralTC 🥜",,5/12/2022,9,427,3,Immigration Issue,Stress

A dangerous trend.* They start by moving away from calling themselves religious orgs and call themselves path provider, guide, coach, engineer.* Then run a marketing campaign with celebrities talking about the struggles of life, while offering courses at really expensive costs while getting all work done by volunteers.* During these courses they ask participants to not divulge the steps or practices to others by scaring them into believing they would cause unbearable health damage to their friends if they did so as they are not trained but are encouraged to ask frnds and family to attend courses. Clear monopolizing techniques.* During the course they basically repackage few yoga steps and call it exercise or kriya will have immediate impact ( it’s yoga obviously it will nothing new here) and talk about magical properties of an ancient seed of tree.* They suggest yoga learnt in regular yoga studios are not teaching it right ( m like really? U are going to go after individually owned studios? How low will you get ? )* further under their umbrella of services ( examples mentioned below) they have started the final stage, they have started selling plots of lands/condos in Midwest with various schemes to get vulnerable people to give up their lives and assets and volunteer for them to wash up spaces or make food in canteen.I do not understand why people elevate such people who con at level of god and flush their common sense down the toilet.These organizations have started marketing in every field using their spirituality brand - cloths, furniture, health foods, books, even schools, yoga, classical dance forms. Most volunteers or patrons do not know if these services are part of non profit parent org or a for profit organization.They have also started different types of schools, some of them advertised as - not planning to teach the current curriculum taught in regular schools and instead just teach traditional arts (dance singing martial arts) and ironically parents seem to be okay with sending kids away to boarding schools in different country which they themselves left?Under the brand name of spirituality n inner peace these organizations are exploiting peoples inability to handle the stresses, lack of purpose and over all general existential crisis all of us will have from time to time. In the guise of providing sanctuary and improvement they end up being the crutch which certain people seem to get sucked into more and more.I mean seriously one does not need much to realize that most of the thing taught in these organizations are just same old stuff repackaged for the current times.It’s difficult to see friends getting sucked into this and sometimes whole families with young kids as well.#cults #spirituality #mentalhealth #commonsense #fitness",,12/14/2021,25,457,6,Family Issue,Stress

Last year my life really spun out of control, depression, divorce, from being in the ER and seeing specialists to canceling my surgery to take care of my dad who was hospitalized for five months.At that time I was dealing with a boss who was treating me like shit for taking a month of caregiver leave. He gave me a horrible end-of-year review, I saw the writing on the wall and switched teams two months ago. My new team has been amazing, my new boss had me switch to being lead within two months and privately told me that my ex-boss was an asshat and is beyond happy with my performance.My work is significantly less, I am treated with respect but after taking my vacation in December I don't feel like working again.

MathWorks,ummamihcat,Anxiety about spouse being disrespectful with parents,"My parents are abroad and are about to visit me for few months. My spouse was disrespectful to them in a similar situation where they stayed with us for couple of months last year. This obviously had upset them, me etc and I fought with my spouse. Everything had sorted out, my spouse apologized, my parents accepted it. I did not get to visit the chemistry because their stay had come to an end and they left soon after the fight.But now I am anxious thinking the history might repeat. I already spoke to my spouse that I am feeling this way and they reassured me but knowing them, I know there are high chances of this to happen again. Can't stop imagining the worst situations. This is in turn is creating hatred for my in-laws who are actually sweet. I want to insult them the same way my spouse did last year. Don't know what to do. #mentalhealthEdit: My spouse is short tempered and they yelled at my parents for talking with each other( not them) while my spouse wanted some silence. there are ways to communicate this, especially to elders while they chose to yell as the first resort. This was totally out of blue and none of us expected this. Morover my spouse argued they didn do anything wrong by yelling at my parents, all they wanted was silence. This got on my nerves as there are polite ways to ask someone to be silent.My parents were/are sweet to my spouse. They have forgotten everything but I cannot. Asking my parents to stay in a hotel will be more disrespectful due to our background. They are coming to spend time with my child as we could not travel due to covid restrictions so I cannot tell them to shorten their stay.My spouse is all fine, talks well with my parents. But I cannot stop thinking when the volcano will erupt.Edit2- I am not a saint either. I am very respectful of someone's feelings till they are respectful of mine, even if it is my partner. Even after knowing the bond I share with my parents, when my spouse behaved this way, I have been unable to digest it. I had almost forgotten it but the moment I got to know my parents are visiting, the anxiety has started. I Know for sure that if something like that happens again, I will hurt my spouse ( not physically) which will affect our relationship. I just don't know how to prepare myself for the worst case scenario. I cannot take it if my parents shut off from me due to my spouse.",,11/8/2021,34,1017,2,Family Issue,Anxiety

I am on a path to Senior if I decide to stay back, I think I will get to Senior by next annual connect, however it’s hard to stay back. So, if I get to interviewing eventually, should I expect to get low balled massively in terms of level and comp. What are some strategies I can adopt before I quit. e.g. schedule Amazon L6 interview now for let’s say March/April rather than reaching out to recruiter 6 months later and only being to get interviews for an L5.4. Will FAANG recruiters still reach out if I honestly update my LI after I quit?5.

The thing is, all these people have others that they're closer to and I don't.It's at the point that I'm thinking about switching jobs (good opportunity, better brand and comp) but I'm close to turning it down because I'll lose these few work friendships/this sense of community I rarely have. I know that's stupid, but I don't want to give up one of the few places I feel like I belong.I hate feeling hopeless/sad/almost desperate anytime others talk about important people in their life, and I'm not ready to give up yet.

Salesforce,LVlE63,Too mentally drained to look for a new job,My job is currently nothing short of soul crushing. I’m in a part of the business where it’s hard for me to see why we are the best place to work. My manager is micromanaging on her good days and bullying and manipulative on her bad days. And there’s a systemic failure where no leaders wants to make hard decisions. Behaviors such as putting your name on something and getting someone else to do all the work and basking in on the glory are rewarded. As a result there are a lot of incompetent people in leadership positions insecure and creating toxic environment to work in.This coupled with the pandemic really drained me to the point that I’ve applied to so many jobs and not resulted in an offer. Partly because I just don’t have the mental energy to “showcase my best” in interviews anymore. I’ve taken a month of medical leave before but it didn’t help because all I can think about was when it was over I’m coming back to this toxic environment. I’m losing sleep at night and I can’t unplug during the weekend. I’m afraid if I quit and just walked away I will lose my career.Any advice on what to do?,,9/17/2021,30,1194,16,Toxic Manager,Others

I NEVER got such a call from anyone checking up on me.And I message people every chance I get. I try to message people I haven't spoken to in a while, I ask them about their life, ask them about their career etc. I just get a short answer and then the conversation goes nowhere. Sometimes not even a 'how are you doing?' in return.

I am struggling to maintain close friends. I feel like people find me nice and would tell me that but not sure why it hasn’t translated to closer friendships lately. I would make effort to reach out, coordinate but often times I get de prioritize or things fall thru last minute. Sometimes I think about maybe why and not sure if some of this could be possibilities: 1) being too introverted and not standing out, 2) being nice where ppl can take advantage not realizing I could be hurt, 3) have other more interesting/better options.

The whole situation messed up my mindset and I didn't know what was wrong (I just knew something was not right) until I was out of that family/environment when I was 28 (I literally escaped).Since then I moved to the U.S. and tried to get help. I read books, went to several therapists, tried a lot, but still there are some times that I get very mad and fallback to the old behavior. It's been 10 years since I realized what mess I grew up in and started to help myself, but it feels like I can never get full control over myself.Now I feel so dysfunctional, down, anxious and mad. I know this time it'll pass (as always) but I also know that it'll come back again as always.Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to vent out.",,10/2/2021,31,682,10,Family Issue,Anxiety

He just hung up on the call with me where we argued heavily and since then has gone awol . He has done these kind of disappearing acts in the past, and coming back after a while saying he misses me .Rather than focus on him, I wish to work on myself and my goals. But there are a few things deterring me from that . I happen to get by the day fairly well ( albeit thinking of him at times, I manage without crying and breaking down or being upset) . At nights however, I have trouble falling asleep until 2:30-3am and sometimes even when I fall asleep at 11pm, I wake up feeling not well rested. I then wake up and chug 2-3 coffees to stay alert for my work day .More than a sleep issue , I see this as something I am going through psychologically .

It’s as if I had to force myself every single morning with all the energy in my bones to push hard.From what I remember, it started after my first internship w a highly reputable company. I thought to myself, “this is it?” The job sucked. And for some reason it has always imprinted on me. I think that didnt incentivize me to try AT THE TIME, but now? Why?I think part of it is that I like having a vision for myself. I don’t really see a path here. I wish I was given a path- do xyz and become abc.This is something that attracts me to the sales industry- hitting numbers and getting promotions- no subjective opinions involved.Still, my circumstances should not determine how hard I work.

Other potential projects don’t really interest me and the work I’m somewhat interested in is a different team. I either want to do work in the other team or shift my job to a different field that I’m interested in. Problem is that I need to study and do some side projects for a shot in the roles I’m interested in, and with my current burnout it’s impossible to get any kind of motivation.Secondly, I have friends who I hangout and do activities with, but they aren’t very good friends. I can’t really discuss my personal struggles with them as they don’t really understand my point of view most of the time. My parents are in a different country and they currently have their own struggles. They expect me resolve issues on my own as I’m an adult now. If I rant too much about my problems, they just tell me to get an arranged married (I’m Indian if that wasn’t obvious). I’m single and definitely want a partner, but arranged marriage has it’s own shitty aspects which I don’t like.Thirdly, my living situation sucks which has intensified my problems. My flatmate is an acquaintance, with whom I hung out a couple of times before joining the house. After we became flatmates, I realized the true nature of this person. He is super snobbish, and doesn’t really interact with me in the house. Things have gotten so weird that I’m uncomfortable being in the same room as this guy. I’m someone who generally hangs out with roommates when all of us are free and get food together sometimes (it acts as a stress buster for me), but at the same time respecting each other’s space. Thankfully my lease is ends next month, and I can’t wait to get out of this house. I don’t want to get a house by myself, as I would get depressed a lot, and having someone in the house who I can hang out with sometimes gives me motivation. Getting a new roommate is like rolling the dice.All these situations together have been messing with my daily life and giving me severe burnout and depression. I have tried taking a vacation but they haven’t been relaxing enough. Started therapy recently, but I’m not getting a good vibe from my therapist after the first 2 sessions. I have lot of personal and professional goals in life, but my current mental state is being a major blocker.Looking for suggestions to help with my mental health.",,5/13/2022,8,255,2,Indians Issue,Stress

Can I change managers within a week?,"I am a PM reporting to a non PM Manager, and he told me I performed really well in 2021, but that my performance in 2022 has been slipping. He has been nitpicking and overanalyzing and making statements during our 1/1 that feel like a lot of personal attacks or pointing out problem areas without real concrete next steps. I scheduled meetings with him to understand his requirements better and I delivered multiple projects ""well"" in the last month. However he continues to be full-on passive aggressive - not responding/ or reviewing my docs and adding tasks to my plate with a manufactured sense of urgency.I also learned that I have no roadmap and no goals assigned to me this year and I brought it up for discussions but am yet to see any actions from his side. Lastly, the Forte feedback from 2021 blew my mind (Meets, Solid Strength). Despite mentioning that I did great in 2021 he has marked core leadership principles like Customer obsession and Ownership as growth areas for me (I should mention he's the only one who marked these). When I asked him why he didn’t provide any specific examples. He also ""paraphrased"" my previous managers feedback on my Forte, taking out the really good bits and making it more vague, essentially giving me no actionable feedback. I don't care about the rating as such, but I don't understand how an HM can half-ass forte feedback and not give me fair credit for the work I did last year, seeing as future HMs refer to these during internal transfers.I am extremely burned out, stressed and I have informal loops next week that I hope will convert.Question:1) If I didn't get proper Forte feedback and concrete examples from him that explain why I got scored poorly on the core LPs, can I escalate to HR? I want to grow and improve and honestly I can't do that with a Manager who does not provide concrete guidance on how I can do it? I also suspect recency bias has crept in based on my 2022 performance because he gave me no examples from 2021.2) Can I move teams within a week ?

My teammates were really nice but all moved to other teams, India, Google in the past few months, the new teammates are all remote for now.I already had a very sociable friend when I moved here and I've hanging out with him and his friends pretty much every weekend, although I appreciate everyone in the group, I just feel like I'm too dependent on him and want to make my own set of friends too. I don't know if my thinking here is wrong or not.Things I've tried:Hobbies: Started playing basketball and made some play-friends? until I sprained my arm, also wasn't really able to take the friendship outside the court.Can't work out for a few months other than running/core so I might try a gym then, any recommendations would be nice!I tried yoga/meditation but ah it's not my cup of tea.Couldn't really find a good place where you can just go and play soccer. Again if anybody knows one would love that.Apps: To find friends, I tried few apps for a while but honestly the experience sucked.Parents: My parents would've been here if not for covid but I guess that would be just be a short term since they aren't really planning to move here altogether.What else should I try?

My brother’s father in law recently got diagnosed of late stage cancer with a few months left at best. My brother’s wife,who is the daughter, is not taking it well. She decided to not telling her father about his diagnosis and faked the test results. It is a common practice in China since family worried about bad news will burden the patient so much to fasten their death… pls don’t judge here as my grandfather also died this way without knowing he got lung cancer. It is a mostly a culture thing. If you need more cultural background, search movie called “the farewell” by Awkwafina. Ok, back to the topic, my brother mother in law is still in the dark, she doesn’t understand the side effect of cancer treatment. What shocks me and the rest of the family is that she not only basically refuses to clean after her spouse’ mess since he lost control of pee/poop. She locked her husband with poop inside his room for 2 hours as a punishment. This is so abusive that my brother’s wife had a mental breakdown. She is so ashamed of this kind of behavior while she can’t publicly share with her friends, relatives or colleagues since majority is still in the dark. So my mother is the only source of emotional outlet. While my mother couldn’t handle it too while as there is also somewhat tension between two families… so my mother eventually told me… I don’t feel too well about this kind of news as there is nothing I can do about anything so far away. I tried to divert the conversation when my mother telling me the news. But she got pissed as I appear not to be very supportive… I wish I could escape all those family drama by limiting my exposure to once a week unless emergency.

I thought it was the area or the house; have moved but not much difference.I feel that there is a certain life style I want to achieve (working out regularly, maintaining the house clean and organized, having a nicely planned playroom for kids, etc.) and I am always falling behind my own bar.I think I am trying and prioritizing things but at the end of the day there is so much undone. Sink is still full of dishes, there are Ikea stuff I got weeks ago but I didn’t have a chance to assemble, I am procrastinating meal planning and grocery and laundry is full.Am I just really lazy? If I become more productive somehow and cross check all the things I want to do to put my life in order, will I feel that I am in control and feel satisfied?Or do I just have a very high bar, working a demanding job, just nobody will have all the things under control?Or should I find a way to be comfortable with the constant chaos and be happy somehow? How do you do that? Even when I am playing with my kids, thinking about all the stuff that needs to be done makes me anxious and annoyed…What is wrong with me?#mentalhealth",,9/19/2021,34,1360,6,Family Issue,Stress

Oracle,BVjz14,A new father's blues story,"Hello Blind, this is my therapy session. That is till I get professional therapy that is, because I feel I really need one. Having said that, this will not be a short post. You've been warned!I first want to show a picture of myself 3/4 months ago. My wife and I were expecting our first baby soon and we couldn't be more thrilled about it! I was the top performer on my team with a promotion in the works, I used the pregnancy months to do hardcore prep for interviews at FAANG thinking I'd leverage the promo to negotiate an even higher salary. Also have been taking my health super seriously and literally went to the gym everyday for the previous 5 months and I was in the best shape I'd ever been in my life! I was on top of the world! I was killing it on all fronts! and I felt amazing! Everything was lined up for the July/August timeframe. Get promoted, get a new position at FAANG, baby comes safely. Life was good.Now fast forward to now, let's start with the good things just not to sound ungrateful. Baby came safely! And I got promoted which led to nice new 380K TC.The bad: I didn't pass my FAANG interviews (It was stupid of me, I only did 3. the big 2 said no, and the 3rd offer was lower than my new TC so I had to reject it).The big one is how stressful, exhausting, emotionally draining, relationship straining being a new parent is! I totally didn't see that coming! And the sleep deprivation! Oh the sleep deprivation!! And I haven't been to the gym in 3 months. I can barely find time to eat so I'm eating junk food all the time (Part of it is emotional I'm sure). I gained 20 lbs already and I look like shit! All those gains earlier in the year are down the drain!My wife and I, both sleep deprived and exhausted, are bickering over stupid things all the time! ""Wipe like this, not like that!"", ""Swaddle like this not like that!"", ""You forgot to do this so someone had to do it!"" and it goes on and on...My wife and I love each other very much, but I feel this past couple of months really tested our marriage. We're very sour towards each other all the time now! And the COVID man...the F**ng COVID! Because of the baby, we're afraid to see anyone, have anyone over or go anywhere. We feel so isolated from everything and everyone.And to top that, I'm back from my parental leave now. And as you can imagine, when you're forced back to a job you were adamant on leaving, and really had high hopes of moving on to something better, it's not a good experience. I loathe every second of everyday I'm there now. And I'm pretty sure it's gonna start reflecting on my performance soon. That definitely adds to the anxiety!Many times in the middle of the night, while rocking my screaming baby. Feeling fat, exhausted and depressed, the screaming stops and I look to find my baby smiling at me. At that moment, as magical as it sounds, I find myself crying. As I don't feel worthy of this angel.Update:Thank you all for the kind comments and advice!

I work in a non tech job and my TC is 145k. I've been stagnant in this same role for 5.5 years in Amazon. I've had opportunities to progress, but my depression and procrastination made sure that I never latched on to any opportunities. I bought 15 Tesla stocks when it was $250 a piece and sold them when they were $400. Thought of investing in bitcoin when it was $120, but hesitated and missed out. All my investment plays turned out bad (mostly due to FOMO plays and unstable decisions). #depression #mentalhealth #depression #mentalhealth After I had suicidal tendencies in the lockdown, I decided to get help. I was diagnosed with clinical depression in August but I stopped seeing my doctor after 2 visits. Just don't feel like doing anything. My friends all got married, bought houses and have kids while I was sitting depressed and jealous. I'd stopped responding to all my friends and spent a lonely life in this quarantine all of 2020. Amazon is definitely not too blame because my manager has been really patient and has helped me a lot through my tough times.In the last 2 weeks I've felt rejuvenated and got the motivation to get my life back in track. I spoke to some of my close friends that I hadn't spoken to in years and felt great. I started looking to switch teams so I get a different environment. But I also want to do something else to keep myself occupied. I was thinking of something that could provide some passive income.

I want to be better, please help!Some background about myself - I started my career in Infosys in India, after a few years of working I got frustrated and applied for Masters in the US.

Bloomberg,Rasr83,I want to vent about working as an Indian software engineer.,"When I was a kid I really liked engineering a lot. My father was a chemical engineer and I thought building things was very cool. I thought I would be building rockets, robots, and all of that stuff when I grew up.But having worked in the industry for about 3.5 to 4 years, I can say that the biggest hurdle to cross in my career is working with other people in my team. And I am at this point of my life where I am really really hating my job a lot. I switched jobs, companies it's all the same.(1) You work as a team, you build on top of what others have built. If they miss a corner case, your application which depends on their code will crash in production. This is frustrating as hell cause it's very hard to think of some of the corner cases when you are dealing with other people's code.(2) Every person has some ideas that are great and some ideas that are shitty. People tend to think that all of their ideas are great. People tend to shove their stupid ideas down the throat of other people. If you are a senior member of the team, you can tell the other person to fuck off and tell them that their ideas are dumb and stupid to their face. But if you are a junior engineer, you pretty much have no option but to build whatever piece of garbage that some dumb-ass senior engineer wanted you to be built. Not every senior engineer is an expert in the field. Some of these so-called senior engineers with 20+ years of experience narrowly dodged getting fired several times in their careers. If age and Wisdom were co-related, all of the geniuses in the world would have been 70 or 80-year-olds.(3) A lot of times, it's not about being technically competent that makes one successful as a software engineer. Almost all of the time, it about having a social IQ and being an obnoxious loudmouth. A lot of people's strategy in meetings is not to let the other people talk. They keep talking over other people to stay in the limelight. To the bystanders, it looks like whoever talks the most is the most knowledgeable person in the team.(4) People do things that are good for the career as opposed to doing things that are good for the team. This means, portraying perfectly good functional software in a bad way just so that they get to reinvent the wheel, re-implement a perfectly working software and use that to get a promotion or whatever. This is fucking annoying as hell to whoever is on-call or whoever has to maintain the new software.On the other end of the spectrum, there is decades old perl, bash scripts, C98 programs etc. that nobody knows what they do and nobody dares to modernize them. And they are the ones that actually need to be modernized.(5) People are selfish. As an individual software engineer, you cannot know everything about everything. Someone at some point has to sit you down and tell you how things work. But people don't share information that freely. They act like your questions are stupid, you are stupid, that you are wasting their time by asking them questions. Cause at the end of the day you know, if they tell you too much, you will know all the dumb things they did when they were building that system. So the default strategy of most people is to keep other people on a need-to-know basis. This is wonderful if you have been on the same team for 10 years or so. It is incredibly painful if you are a new person to a team.(6) People get senselessly defensive over minor things to protect their ego. A person in my team is a C++ expert. He is really very knowledgeable about C++ and about Solaris operating systems. But he is a complete knob when it comes to Python. He would write code like this:elementFound = falsefor i in range(0, len(arr)):if arr[i] == targetElement:elementFound = trueIt's painful as hell to convince him to change his code when you are reviewing his Python code. But it is even more painful when he turns around and harasses you to change your Python because he does not understand what you wrote and thinks that makes it unreadable.(7) Then there are stupid Biases and shit that people have. There was a guy I know whose father was an assistant prof in a college who went to Princeton. He literally could not write SQL for simple tasks like inserting a record or deleting stuff from a table. People used to overlook every stupid thing he did for the first 8 months or so when he was a fresh out of college graduate.Eventually, everything he put in production started crashing left and right. Even the most basic things that he was asked to build had bugs in them. He was eventually let go after about 2.5 years. But the first 1 year in that job, he was treated like a god because of his stupid Princeton degree. If you are the stereotypical person in the industry, i.e. Indian with a master's from a tier two college in the US on an H1b. People will treat you like shit, till you start questioning your own self-worth.I can go on and on, but essentially what I am saying is that a lot of the time I feel like my job is to do social engineering rather than doing actual engineering. It's one thing to adjust once or twice. But you have to put up with this shit for months together, it starts to take a toll on your mental health. I am starting to understand why everyone hates Mondays. The things I care about today are getting a green card or getting to 250k TC or some superficial crap like that. When I was 16 or 17, I used to idolize Da-Vinci. I was genuinely interested in engineering. But having worked in the industry for the last 4 years or so, I feel so disenchanted with this profession. It's so depressing. If you ask me today what is the one thing I hate about my job the most, it is working with other people.",,5/17/2021,32,3255,34,Indians Issue,Others

It was a huge mess for a while and I pushed my start date already to late April (initial was late March). I'm still managing the affairs, haven't quit my current job yet, and really just want some time off.I'm planning to send the following email to my new manager. I wanted to check if people think it's rude or egregious before sending (quick context, my dad had a small business as single income for the family, I had to manage the business when he passed):Hi manager,I hope you've been doing well. I'm sorry for the late reply, time definitely flew for me the last few weeks.I was able to hire someone to replace my dad, so I've been onboarding them and offboarding myself, so things have been smoother on that end. I'm still actively helping my mom manage the estate and get her back on her feet. I recently resumed doing a light amount of work at my current role, and plan to hand in my notice next week most likely.I was hoping to push the start date back again if that's possible. I also have a few family events that I would very much like to attend in late May and early June. Specifically, May 19 - 24 and June 9 - 14. Candidly, if it works for you and the team, I'd appreciate starting after then. I also totally understand that's a much further out start date than you'd initially planned for, so I'm happy to talk about it. Ultimately, I absolutely don't want to jeopardize the job or make things harder for you and the team, but also want to prioritize family time and have a smooth transition without interruptive time off.Thank you again for being kind through this process, please let me know what you think, and again, happy to talk about it in more detail.---TC tax: old job 220k, new job 300kYOE: 5#advice",,3/30/2022,10,277,1,Family Issue,Others

Amazon,wawY45,Your best story trying to secure anxiety/depression diagnosis for FMLA/STDI at Amazon,"It's very difficult to secure a psychotherapist in the middle of Covid. Everyone's mental health is affected, no openings, noone accepting new clients, noone even answers the phone calls or returns the messages, all schedule is booked for over 4 weeks.So, earlier today, I've reached to some older lady who had a very low $$ rate on Psychology Today, yet has many social justice specialities. Well, noone Christian was available, so, had take what was on the menu.I call her up, to my surprise she picks up, and immediately I recognize she's impossible to talk to, because she's overly friendly, attentive and concerned for me when talking to me, with the kind of fake smile you can hear a mile away. The kind of fake concerns that's really annoying to hear, but because noone else would even talk to me, I've decided I'll try her out, for the free consultation at least.So, I mention I work at Amazon, and she tell me she has experience with Google! She almost immediately starts bad-mouthing Google not caring about employees, not being like the old days anymore. (What?) I try to contain my TC-or-GTFO and rest-and-vest attitudes, and try to calmly defend Google, and explain that Amazon's got nothing on Google! All over the phone. Trying to explain the URA quota was quite entertaining.Long story short, I then mention FMLA, she slyly says that she's heard of it. I mention STDI, and she slyly says she's heard of that one, too! However, she immediately tells me that she can't take me as a client. (What?) She says it's too much paperwork, she doesn't like paperwork. (Who is the one to require the therapy here?)I plead that it's impossible to find anyone, and noone else wants to help if I mention #LOA!She says not to give up, and almost out of nowhere suggests I go to a library to get a list of the symptoms of anxiety/depression, including ""battling depression for 2 years"", and do it ""the American way"" (her words, not mine!).Weirdly enough, her advice also included telling me to tell other Psychotherapists that I'm looking for FMLA/STDI right away, instead of trying to create an entrance. I've tried to refer to my autism, and ask whether it's appropriate to ask for FMLA/STDI right away, but she assured me that some therapists wouldn't mind and would be happy for me being direct, and that I'll find someone. Thoughts?I'm left wondering who'd actually hire her, even if she's half the cost of other professionals.#burnout #depression #mentalhealth #anxiety #stdi #fmla #amazonbenefits",,11/10/2021,24,822,3,Therapist Issue,Burnout

Bloomberg,Rasr83,How do you deal with rude people who are constantly misbehaving with you?,"I am an Indian male and I speak with an Indian accent. I came to the US in 2015 and have been living in New Jersey most of this time. I tend to be very introverted, shy and I don't typically prefer to pick fights with people. You can almost say that I am meek. I am lean and about 5'7"" Back in India, I dealt with my fair share of rude and hostile people. But I always thought that it was normal for India. Now, even in the US, I am facing the same issues and honestly, it is starting to affect my mental health, and I feeling like I don't matter at all. I am losing my self-esteem and almost feel scared to go to a shop these days.For example, I went to a grocery store and I gave the store clerk my keychain with the rewards card on it. I was putting my card into the card machine and she simply throws away my keychain. She is staring at me angrily. I was supposed to take it off of her hand and since I was working the card machine I didn't. She felt I wasted her time so she threw away my keychain.The other day I went into a store in Jersey City and I spent a little longer than usual trying to find what I was looking for her. The store clerk who is in his 40s, comes to me and says ""What the fuck are you looking for?"", I said ""What?"", then he starts shouting at me and all.This one time I went to Walmart to buy a tablet and the store clerk fetches it for me. I ask her what color it is, and she says ""We only have one color, take it or leave it I don't care"".This happens constantly at work too. I ask someone for help and they start yelling at me for no reason.Usually, I let these kinds of things past, but sometimes when I am in a bad mood myself, I react to it and start shouting back at them. It just turns into an ugly situation. What do you do when you are dealing with these kinds of people.

Not FANG but TC is 250k in a LCOL area (Atlanta) so I'm proud of what I've accomplished. However, I'm starting to feel a little distanced from my 3 year old daughter. I find myself spending time thinking about work and glued to my phone when I should be with her. She's my life, I love her more than anything, and feel like I'm just missing out because I'm distracted. I also let my work stress spill over into my personal life, and find myself being short with her during very stressful times. Medication helps with the latter but has other negative effects (constantly being tired). I have 1.3m net worth (around 700k of that is liquid investments and some cash, too) and am thinking about taking a break for a while. My wife doesn't work though so I feel a little trapped since we'd lose health insurance. In some ways it sounds like a terrible idea but I also feel this precious time slipping by. Would taking a break when Im making good money and am starting to be recognized at work be a mistake? Or is my instinct to take a year or two off to destress and reconnect with my girl a sound one?

Funny thing is it happens more frequently and more intense before flight than during the flight.Up until now I have always managed to take flights without taking any medication.Few years back I talked to my doctor and he prescribed small dose of Zoloft for few months. I took that and then I was just fine.Now recently is happening again. When I talked to doctor this time (different doctor). She suggested me to take Ativan before the flight.When I read online I see there are some therapies that can help minor situations like me.

But it was bound for failure coz she “just didn’t feel attracted to me anymore”.Despite how it ended, she had such an impact on me - I could not replicate that feeling of connection with anyone else I dated after her.Dating just feels hopeless these days, everyone’s not their authentic self and always seem to have one foot out the date. The loneliness hits extra in the winter with 4pm cold sunsets.And dating’s just extra hard being a woman over 30, everyone wants to get married in under a year(which is fine, just would’nt work with me).But hey, on the bright side at least I go on a date every now and then so it’s not “all” bad 😪Family:After physically and mentally tortured by conservative parents for about 29 years, it’s been fkn great for my mental health since the 2 years I went no contact with them.I feel so free in life, like I can breath for the first time. Have full control over my own life and not be scared of narcissistic parents for doing anything.But during thanksgiving or Christmas holidays, it hurts when I see my peers and friends have good moments with their families.Especially being single, it hits really hard that there’s not a single person who cares about me.Work/career:Work’s been great since the pandemic(I hope I don’t get hate for this, I founs a way to make it work for me). My manager has been accommodating with flexible work hours yet gave me a space at work where I feel comfortable to grow.

A much better situation from almost jumping off a roof a few years ago.But I keep getting sad about how much of a better life I could’ve had with a less messed up childhood and a lot less damaging habits I picked up over the course.Overall, 2021 has been a mixed bad of shit and “its not so bad” stuff.I have no idea about how to feel about anything going on in life.Feels like I am falling behind for my age at times.But at times I feel like I couldn’t have done anything better with the terrible starting hand I got dealt.Sometimes I feel like I should take responsibility into my own hands and stop blaming others about how things ended.But everything would’ve been a lot easier to handle, if I just had a warm shoulder to embrace during times of pain. People advice to learn to be happy by yourself. But companionship really helps with the tough parts of life that self love just cannot.Oh well, I wonder what 2022/year 32 have in store for me.The ever ticking clock of life waits for no one.",,12/11/2021,7,814,15,Family Issue,Stress
Salesforce,QQxE10,Mental health issues due to my manager,"I have debilitating anxiety because of my manager. I am on H1B and I am India-born which means the wait for GC is very long. After seeing a therapist, I have realized that that anxiety is basically due to helplessness. I'm constantly afraid that my manager will fire me. I've been crying a lot. I never thought Salesforce could become such a horrible place to work. I had planned to switch jobs in July 2020 because I knew that I wouldn't be able to endure this kind of poor treatment but sadly Covid happened. And for a while the job market completely froze and around the same time my anxiety became debilitating where I cannot seem to focus on work.I have been advised to remove some details for privacy reasons.

New,bUYI65,Careers for the unreliable,"Does anyone else have trouble being consistent? I’m a really great passionate worker 90% of the time. I love what I do and I devote myself to it fully.However, I really struggle with mental health + physical disabilities. This means that 10% of the time, I’m not only bad, but usually completely absent. For example, I’ll sleep for 72 hours straight. This means that occasionally I just completely disappear without warning from society/friends/work.So far, this hasn’t been an issue (ie I’ve never been fired/failed out of school etc), but it weighs on me heavily. I also have to assume it could be a hurdle preventing promotions.I’ve been “successful”, meaning I went to a top 4 undergrad + grad program, had jobs at top startups + FAANGs, etc, however being unreliable in this way has really weighted on me emotionally.Are there any good careers for people like me? Places where it’s ok for me to disappear without warning as long as I continue to perform in the ~95th%+ percentile the rest of the time.#mentalhealth",,4/14/2022,7,267,3,Job Issues,Mental Health

I have aspirations and things that I want to do to make myself happy and feel confident, but for some reason I'm always hesitant before taking the step. I always fear failure is going to drag me down and hence I don't even put any effort to start with. I'm in constant need of appreciation and validation and generally do things to make others happy. I rarely feel like I do anything for myself.For instance, I bought a car recently with my boyfriend but I don't know how to drive. He is the one who drives us around when we go on trips or anywhere else. I want to learn how to drive, but I feel hesitant deep inside. I feel like I won't be able to do it. I feel hesitant to put any effort to work towards learning it, although I want it badly. He has been constantly asking me to learn how to drive when I have some time in hand, and this makes me feel even more miserable because he's having to tell me all of this.I don't know how to fix myself..Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words and suggestions.

Capital One,burnoutnow,Feeling burnout,"I've been very impatient and angry at home lately. Just realized I'm experiencing burnout.I personally don't think I have as much work and stress as the folks at Amazon or AWS have but I'm feeling it. Juggling my job, family and a degree at the same time. Poor choice you might say.I thought about talking to my manager but he doesn't seem like the type who are interested in talking to people: often interrupts people during meetings. He's not the angry type. Maybe he's stressed out as well. He's pushing for his promotion hard and encourages people to work hard (weekend, after hours).Also the dang stack ranking. My peers who are single and younger are pushing hard and I don't have the time or energy to compete with them. I don't feel comfortable talking to my boss about my burnout. Some of my coworkers are nice and helpful. Some just toss a few lines of slack messages to respond or just ignore my questions.No, I'm putting on my nice face at work. No issues at work at all. I still close my tickets on time and help new folks. No incidents, arguments or heated debates with anyone.I haven't had a full night sleep for almost 2 years because I have a young child with the teething, fever, sickness from daycare, etc. If you have kids, you'll understand.I've tried to maintain regular exercises but I could only work out late at night (take care of family until 8pm). I constantly feel exhausted. I fell sick last week and had to stop working out. Will get back to my routine next week.My degree isn't difficult. I can do it. It just eats a big chunk of my time to write stupid papers and deal with unresponsive classmates in group projects. I don't want to pause or cancel because my partner wants another baby soon. Time isn't on our side. I'd rather finish the degree before she delivers. Having 1 more kid isn't making my life easier. That's why I hesitate to drop the degree.Family life suffers because of my bad temper. I can't leave my family. I don't want to drop my degree for the reasons above. I've been thinking about quitting but it'll affect my family's insurance and budgets. I have people to feed, cannot just quit. I've been applying. No interviews yet.I really don't know. Any ideas? How did you cope with your burnout and get out of it?UPDATE:- Thank you all for your kind words and suggestions. I really appreciate your time. I can't reply to all of you. Sorry about that.- I'll take some days off and focus on mental health. I'll probably read the book one of you mentioned.- Given what I know at Capital One right now, I doubt moving to another team will be better for my situation. My friends all have left. It's also impossible to read a manager's true intention within a 45 min interview unless I have inside info from his/her team. I'll keep looking internally and externally.- I'm applying to companies that have good WLB reputation. Haven't had luck with Microsoft, Google or Salesforce. I've also applied to mid tier companies.- My partner was affected by the pandemic so just got a new job. The pay is just enough to cover daycare and the benefits aren't great. We have saving but I don't want to use that (yet) if we don't have to. She is currently taking care of our kid most of the time. I just cannot let her do that all by herself. I think it's my responsibility to share the workload with my partner taking care of our kid. We decided that it's better for her to join the workforce for a while when she can before she has to take off to deliver another kid in the future.- My kid knows I'm sitting in our bedroom working/doing course work and bangs on the door for me to come out and play. It's hard.- We're thinking about moving to Austin or FL but given what's been going on there, we're looking elsewhere.TC: 🥜+☎️ (on call) + 📚(stack ranking) #burnout #depression #mentalhealth",,9/12/2021,27,2569,5,Family Issue,Stress

Amazon,wawY45,Does TheWorkNumber show up your FMLA Leave of Absence or STDI status? Is it permanent or only during the leave?,"It's illegal for an employer to discriminate based on a disability condition.The HR is required to maintain your FMLA health documentation separately from the rest of your employee files. At Amazon, this task is done by DLS (Disability & Leave Services HR), which is completely separate from the HRBP (HR Business Partner) that's responsible for your PIP (Focus/Pivot).However, if you take FMLA, and get STDI, you'll have something like ""Short Term Dis"" show up on your payroll as the itemized item for the up to 60% of pay you may be getting. (Provided that the STDI is paid out directly by the employer.) This doesn't mean you took a mental health leave; I believe a Parental Leave would show the same.It's been reported that during the Leave, Equifax's TheWorkNumber might also show your status as On Leave.Also, the sample TheWorkNumber report has a field for Workers Comp; it's unclear whether an STDI is more private or not.Does anyone know if STDI or FMLA show up on TheWorkNumber more permanently than a simple ""On Leave"" checkbox during the leave itself?
